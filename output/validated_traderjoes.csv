apricot-mango-greek-whole-milk-yogurt-077291,Apricot Mango Greek Whole Milk Yogurt," Trader Joe’s Apricot Mango Greek Yogurt is made with Grade A Whole Milk. This might conjure images of super fatty milk in your mind, but in truth, whole milk is just ‘milk as it comes from the cow’—with none of its original milk fat removed. And that original milk fat isn’t as much as one might think. Whole milk doesn’t even contain twice as much milk fat as does 2% milk. Still, it’s enough extra fat to give Whole Milk Yogurt a creamier texture—a trait that classic Greek yogurt really showcases.   Beyond the thick, creamy mouth feel, we’ve also included bits of apricot and mango, with additional fruit juices, to give this Yogurt a tinge of tropical flavor. There are also a host of live and active cultures (added after pasteurization) meant to help bolster the presence of “good bacteria” in your gut.   Take a tub to work for an easy breakfast. Mix it with some Müesli for a heartier snack. You can enjoy it anytime.

korean-style-beef-short-ribs-090809,Korean Style Beef Short Ribs," Here’s a quick dinner idea we think will really excite you! Trader Joe’s Korean Style Beef Short Ribs. It’s a simple entrée, really – lean beef short ribs marinated in a Korean style sweet and savory soy-based marinade. In the marinade, soy sauce and garlic account for the Ribs savory flavors, then brown sugar is added to make it deliciously sweet. The combination is simple, yet phenomenal.   The genius is really in the preparation, and that’s where you come in. In about 15 minutes (if you count the time it takes to thaw the meat), these simple Short Ribs cook to utter perfection – just pop them on a grill – or grill pan on the stovetop – at medium-high heat, cook for a couple of minutes on each side and, you’re done. See? Genius! Before devouring, the Beef should be cooked thoroughly, at 160 degrees Fahrenheit or higher measured by a food thermometer.

hydrolyzed-collagen-powder-074194,Hydrolyzed Collagen Powder," Collagen is a protein found naturally in our tendons, ligaments, muscles, and cartilage—in fact, it’s the most common protein found within the bodies of most mammals. Some say collagen is beneficial to our health, and even our appearance. The human body, however, produces less and less collagen for itself as we age, so some folks turn to dietary supplements to support their joint health, skin health, and hair health. Which is precisely why we carry Trader Joe’s Hydrolyzed Collagen Powder: made with pure, unflavored, powdered beef collagen, it’s a consummately convenient way to introduce more collagen into your diet.   Our supplier prepares each batch via a hydrolysis process that leaves the proteins so fine that they easily dissolve into all kinds of hot and cold drinks. Just add two scoops of Collagen Powder (using the scoop that’s provided in each pouch, naturally) to your morning cold brew, afternoon smoothie, or evening cup of tea, then mix, and enjoy. Each serving provides 12 grams of collagen to your daily regimen, and is virtually odorless and flavorless, making it a great option for simply mixing into a glass of water. However you enjoy it, you’re sure to enjoy our value: Trader Joe’s Hydrolyzed Collagen Powder is three dollars less than the brand we previously offered on our shelves—for the same amount of product!

chiles-rellenos-con-queso-075234,Chiles Rellenos con Queso," A much-beloved mainstay of Mexican cuisine, the chile relleno is a masterclass of complementary flavors and textures: each bite manages to combine the gooeyness of melted cheese, the tenderness of a fire-roasted pepper, and the crispiness of its egg-battered exterior, all at once. Of course, a dish with such a delightfully complex eating experience usually results from an equally complex cooking experience, and one doesn't always have the time to fire-roast, stuff, batter, and fry a whole pepper. That's what makes Trader Joe's Chiles Rellenos Con Queso so convenient-now, having a hearty chile relleno at home is simply a matter of letting it cook in the microwave, air fryer, or conventional oven, heating the included zesty tomato sauce on the stove or microwave, combining, and enjoying.   An always-excellent entrée or appetizer, our frozen Chiles Rellenos make an especially great vegetarian option for a weeknight dinner or weekend lunch. For a quick and easy meal, try pairing them with a side of rice and beans, which will also help soak up the rich and flavorful sauce. Of course, if you're feeling extra hungry, you can always use one as the filling for a super satisfying burrito, along with some diced tomatoes, onions, and our Organic Chunky Homestyle Guacamole.

irish-cheddar-cheese-with-irish-whiskey-078395,Irish Cheddar Cheese with Irish Whiskey," Just in time to help celebrate St. Patrick’s Day, our March Spotlight Cheese showcases two specialties of Irish craftsmanship at once: sharp, savory Cheddar, and rich, aromatic whiskey. Indeed, Trader Joe’s Irish Cheddar with Irish Whiskey comes to us from a seasoned creamery in Ireland, whose expertise with spirits-infused cheeses has won them awards and accolades. Here, their Irish Cheddar is subtly flavored with authentic Irish Whiskey so that its delicately oaky and fruity notes complement, rather than overpower, the creamy texture and slight tanginess of the cheese.   Excellent for cheese boards, charcuterie plates, and party platters of all kinds (though especially for those served at St. Patrick’s Day get-togethers!), Trader Joe’s Irish Cheddar with Irish Whiskey can be enjoyed entirely on its own, or as part of a larger recipe. It’s excellent when crumbled over salads, sliced and melted over a burger or grilled cheese, mixed into a macaroni bake, or any other dish that could do with a bit of creamy complexity. And for a fun, sublimely simple pairing, try a slice or two alongside our TJ’s Special Reserve Irish Whiskey, on the rocks or as part of highball.

strawberry-overnight-oats-077656,Strawberry Overnight Oats," When we introduced them to our refrigerators back in 2019, our Overnight Oats were an overnight sensation.

We soak said oats in a coconut beverage (water + coconut = coconut beverage), then blend them with strawberry purée, strawberry purée concentrate, and strawberry juice concentrate, plus a dash of salt for good measure. The end result makes for a sweet, simple meal-on-the-go, a hearty-in-a-hurry afternoon snack, and a tasty way to refuel after a workout. And while these Oats are, of course, great on their own, they also take well to customization—try adding a dollop of your favorite TJ’s yogurt, some strawberry slices, and a handful of chocolate chips for extra flair.

spicy-tempura-seaweed-snack-074086,Spicy Tempura Seaweed Snack," Light, crispy, and utterly abounding with umami, roasted seaweed is perhaps as close to perfect as a snack food can get. But even that level of near-perfection can be improved upon, especially when that improvement involves a dash of spicy, savory seasoning and a crunchy tempura coat. Need proof? Look no further than Trader Joe’s Spicy Tempura Seaweed Snack! They’re made for us by a supplier in Thailand, who takes sheets of nori harvested from a seaweed farm in Korea, dips them in savory, starchy tempura batter and fries them until they’re superlatively crisp, then finishes them off with a fiery, togarashi-inspired seasoning blend. Each and every bite is crunchy, spicy, bursting with savory flavor, and, somehow, better than the last.   Trader Joe’s Spicy Tempura Seaweed Snack can be enjoyed totally on its own, as a companion to sports spectation, movie marathoning, or any other occasion that calls for something satisfyingly crunchy. It also makes a remarkably apt chip for scooping up all kinds of savory dips—although we’re particularly partial to pairing it up with other maritime flavors, like ceviche. And is if that weren’t enough, it also lends a tremendous pop of texture when crumbled over salads, soups, and rice bowls.

irish-porter-cheddar-cheese-052529,Irish Porter Cheddar Cheese," The three-leafed shamrock, first associated with Saint Patrick, has been an Irish symbol for several centuries. Unfortunately, we weren't able to fashion pieces of Trader Joe's Irish Porter Cheddar Cheese shaped like shamrocks, but we've made up for its ordinary cheese shape with its unique, festive flavor.   The milk from our Irish Porter Cheddar comes from cows grazing in the green fields of County Limerick and County Cork in western Ireland. The Cheddar curds, once formed, are mixed with Irish porter, which was known as ""plain porter"" or simply ""plain"" in Ireland when it was first created. It's a dark beer made with a few types of malt that gives the cheese its distinct marbled appearance and a decidedly roasted, malty taste.    Clearly, this Irish Cheddar is ideal for enjoying with a St. Patrick's Day meal. Try it sliced with crusty, warm slices of an Organic French Baguette and a pint of Guinness to taste the full porter flavors. Have it alongside a meal of Corned Beef or Irish Bangers and mashed potatoes, and toast sláinte* to those around you.   * sláinte: an Irish toast meaning ""to your health!""

papas-rellenas-076125,Papas Rellenas," An essential element of countless cuisines across Latin America and the Caribbean, the papa rellena might just be the ideal comfort food. While exact recipes vary, region to region, they're typically made by stuffing savory-seasoned ground beef into a ball of mashed potatoes, which is then rolled in breadcrumbs and fried until it's crispy, golden brown, and mouthwateringly delicious. On paper, it sounds a little like a spicier, appetizer version of a shepherd's pie. As Trader Joe's Papas Rellenas ably demonstrate, on the palate, it's so much more.    Drawing inspiration from the Cuban variation of this classic, comfy croquette, Trader Joe's Papas Rellenas are made with a picadillo-esque filling of ground beef, diced onions and bell peppers, along with a lively blend of herbs and seasonings like garlic, oregano, and black pepper.

cheery-lemon-animal-crackers-077828,Cheery Lemon Animal Crackers," Let's list some cheery things, shall we? Sunshine, laughing children, a well-whistled tune... Now, let's add Trader Joe's Cheery Lemon Animal Crackers to the list! It's not just their name that makes these Crackers so Cheery. In fact, the actual cheeriness of these Crackers came first, prompted by the bright yellow yogurt coating and rainbow-colored nonpareils-aka crunchy candy sprinkles. (Incidentally, all the happy hues in these Crackers derive from simple sources including vegetable juice, beta-carotene, and turmeric.)   The grinspiration of these Crackers is further found in the chipper crunch of their lightly sweet, cookie-like character. Multiplying this mirth, each Cracker is cut into one of 13 unique & gladsome Animals, including: bears, elephants, cats, donkeys, goats, tigers, lions, horses, cows, rhinos, camels, bison, and hippos. And the capstone of this trouble-tromping Trader Joe's treat is its creamy, yogurt coating, with authentic citrus aroma & lemony zing.   May we mention one more aspect of Trader Joe's Lemon Animal Crackers that is sure to elicit cheer? It's the single-serving package that virtually invites itself along on all your daily excursions, whether big or small, near or far. Hip, hip, hooray for Cheery Lemon Animal Crackers!

Of course, now we’re talking about a product, not a piece of advice. Patently styled after our iconic Hold the Cone! Mini Ice Cream Cones, which are found in our freezers, these Cone Tips are cookies, not ice cream. In effect, we’ve removed the entire top portion of the cone (including the ice cream), leaving behind a conical nugget, the crunchiest part or the Waffle Cone, where the seam comes to a point. Their colossal crunch is complemented by a rich filling of smooth, dark chocolate—not unlike what you find at the bottom of our Mini Ice Cream Cones.   Another point we’d like to make—and what may really tip the scales for serious serial snackers—is the fact that these Cones Tips require no refrigeration. That’s right, they’re 100% portable, and ready to eat anytime you need a Tip to top-off a meal, or to counter a savory snack with the crunch of something sweet.

steamed-chicken-soup-dumplings-054988,Steamed Chicken Soup Dumplings," Soup goes in a bowl or in a cup—unless, of course, you are a fan of Xiao Long Bao. Then, your soup goes in a dumpling. Trader Joe’s Steamed Chicken Soup Dumplings are a wonder to behold, both for their display of Chinese food innovation, and for their incredibly comforting flavor profile.   This concept originates in the Jiangnan region of southeastern China, where Shanghai is situated. Xiao Long Bao are essentially soup dumplings, but instead of dumplings that go in the soup (though you can still certainly make this happen), the soup actually goes inside these dumplings. Our expert Chinese dumpling supplier forms their wheat flour dumpling dough with a specially formulated proprietary production method that seals each dumpling, allowing them to hold the maximum amount of savory broth—broth made from ingredients includ- ing chicken, onion, green onion, soy sauce, and ginger. Once the soup is wrapped in the dough and sealed (Bao means “wrapped” in Chinese), it is steamed until fully cooked (Xiao Long refers to a traditional Chinese bamboo steamer). Lastly, our dumplings are put into microwave-safe packages and frozen so we can deliver them to you.   To enjoy, you simply cut the corner of the bag and microwave for 1 to 2 minutes. Let your Dumplings sit for at least another minute before removing from microwave. The insides will be very hot, so be careful! We suggest placing a hot Soup Dumpling on a deep Chinese soup spoon and nibbling a little hole in the side to let the soup run out before enjoying soup and dumpling together.

blackened-salmon-seasoned-boneless-fillet-078215,Blackened Salmon Seasoned Boneless Fillet," Salmon is far and away the most popular fresh seafood that we carry at Trader Joe’s, and it’s easy to see why. Nutritious, versatile, and remarkably easy to work with, salmon typically only needs a bit of seasoning before it’s ready to be cooked. Over the years, we’ve received many requests from our customers for pre-seasoned salmon, to make it even easier to go from the fridge to the dinner table. That’s precisely why we’re introducing Trader Joe’s Blackened Salmon to our fresh meat and seafood section.   These boneless, skin-on fillets come prepped and ready with a mélange of savory (and slightly spicy) seasonings, including garlic, onion, smoked paprika, chipotle peppers, and demerara sugar on its surface. As it cooks in the pan, oven, broiler, or especially the air fryer, this layer of seasonings creates a flavorful and texturally satifying Blackened outer crust. A sublimely simple entrée option for everything from busy weeknight dinners to meal- prepped work lunches, and beyond, we recommend pairing Trader Joe’s Blackened Salmon with a bed of fluffy white rice, a few spears of steamed asparagus, and an oaky, buttery Chardonnay, like our very own Big Churn.

This the-more-the-merrier spirit is at the heart of Trader Joe’s Brookie Caramel Candy Clusters, an impressively indulgent sweet treat that’s now available at your neighborhood Trader Joe’s.   Each Cluster is made with a mix of broken-up bits of brownie and chocolate chip cookie, which are held together with a generous dollop of rich, gooey caramel. This, in itself, would make an exceptional confection, but it’s just the beginning. Our supplier enrobes the base of each caramel-cookie-brownie combo with melted dark chocolate, then drizzles it with even more dark chocolate, before finishing with a light sprinkle of sea salt.

french-vanilla-ice-cream-078576,French Vanilla Ice Cream," Trader Joe’s French Vanilla Ice Cream is a super premium vanilla ice cream that talks the talk - we don’t mean French; we mean the language of flavor! Our rich French Vanilla Ice Cream has an unmistakably creamy-custard texture that can be enjoyed plain or used as a companion for any combination of cookies, candies, and chocolates.   What makes a quart of French vanilla ice cream “French”, you ask? It has nothing to do with the vanilla bean itself (which is only grown near the equator, not near France at all); it merely means that the ice cream begins with a base that contains egg yolks, unlike regular vanilla ice cream. Trader Joe’s French Vanilla Ice Cream is made in this French tradition, which ultimately lends a pale-yellow color and a richer, smoother consistency than traditional vanilla ice cream. Notice that super premium designation? To get there, an ice cream must have less than 50% overrun, meaning that one gallon of mix would create no more than one and a half gallons of finished ice cream. Trader Joe’s French Vanilla Ice Cream has 26% overrun - aka dense, super SUPER premium ice cream!

Let me count the shreds"" ~with apologies to Elizabeth Barrett Browning   Trader Joe’s Finely Shredded Lite Mexican Blend is our ideal blend for dishes in need of a little Mexican flair, with reduced fat Cheddar, Monterey Jack, Asadero and Queso Quesadilla cheeses. It’s a blend that’s unique to Trader Joe’s, and because of this boasts a flavor profile just as unique as our brand. The Jack, Asadero and Queso Quesadilla are mild, while the Cheddar adds a bit of a bite with every mouthful.   All of the cheeses are well-known for their meltability, which makes them a particularly potent pairing to dishes like burritos, enchiladas, quesadillas and tacos. And don’t let the name make you feel like you need to limit yourself to Mexican dishes. This blend is excellent in plenty of salads, atop any of our boxed soups, and makes a distinctively flavored grilled cheese sandwich.

This Peanut Butter is made with just two ingredients: peanuts and salt. That’s it. The ingredients don’t necessarily say a whole lot (it is just two ingredients), but it actually does. It goes without saying that there are no sweeteners, binders, or added oils and that speaks volumes about our Peanut Butter. The peanuts are dry roasted, made into the most delicious, Crunchy and Salted Peanut Butter.   Unlike some other peanut butters with added partially hydrogenated oils, ours does not solidify – the oils do separate from the solids. A good stir gets it ready to roll. A hint: store it upside down before you open it – this simplifies the stirring and keeps the natural oils from separating so much. Come in (to the grocery aisle). Buy some Peanut Butter. Save some bread. Talk about value!

You may be tempted to assume that Trader Joe’s Dark Chocolate Lover’s Chocolate Bar, with 85% Cacao, would stand with the bitter faction. But we all know what happens when you assume, right?   Okay, then. This really is a dark chocolate lover’s chocolate bar. Chocolate from Colombia’s Tumaco region is known for its fruity flavor profile, and ours doesn’t disappoint. The rich, 85% cacao has a bit of sugar and natu- ral vanilla flavor that enhances the cacao’s natural flavor and takes away much of the bitterness typically associ- ated with dark dark chocolate bars. Our supplier grows the cocoa beans, harvests the beans, roasts the beans and turns them into chocolate. They also make and package the individual bars for Trader Joe’s. Generally, all of these processes are done by individual companies & craftspeople. By keeping it all in one place, we are better able to control both quality and cost.

A mainstay on our grocery shelves for more than 25 years, it provides the ultimate in made-from-scratch flavor without the made-from-scratch effort—in fact, it’s repeatedly named “Best Brownie Mix” by home cooks and baking pros alike. The inclusion of Dutch cocoa in the Mix lends rich, chocolatey flavor and helps create the signature, fudgy Brownie base, to which plenty of chocolate chips are added; when baked, the chocolate chips offer surprise bursts of even more melty-chocolatey goodness throughout.    All that stands between you and a fresh batch of brownies is a stick of butter, two eggs, and about 25 minutes in the oven. You’ll be rewarded with brownies that are moist and fudgy in the middle, with delightfully chewy edges. If experimenting in the kitchen is your idea of an adventure, this Mix provides an excellent foundation for recipe riffing—try adding handfuls of chopped walnuts and dried cherries, or a drizzle of tahini or caramel sauce (or both!) to the batter before baking.

aglio-olio-seasoning-blend-077636,Aglio Olio Seasoning Blend," Aglio e olio (that’s Italian for “garlic and oil”) is a classic Neapolitan dish, consisting of long pasta (often spaghetti) tossed in a sauce of pantry staples, including olive oil, plenty of thinly sliced garlic, and chili flakes.

Packed into a shakeable glass jar, this Blend combines the beloved Italian flavor components of the dish in dried form, along with parsley flakes and sea salt—no more slicing slippery garlic cloves!

bourbon-vanilla-bean-paste-076862,Bourbon Vanilla Bean Paste," If you’ve ever spent any time baking, you’ve likely dealt with vanilla extract before (it’s basically the duct tape of the baking world). What you might not have encountered, however, is vanilla paste. What’s the difference, you ask? Aside from their distinct methods of production (vanilla extract is made by soaking pure vanilla beans in a solution of water and alcohol, whereas vanilla paste is a mix of vanilla beans, sugar syrup, and some vanilla extract to tie them all together), vanilla paste is thicker, richer in taste, and tends to have more visible bits of vanilla bean throughout, making it a preferable option for recipes where you really want the vanilla to be front and center. And that’s exactly where Trader Joe’s Bourbon Vanilla Bean Paste excels.   Made for us by a supplier in Mauritius with 100% Bourbon (as in, grown in one of the designated Bourbon islands within the Indian Ocean) Vanilla Beans, this Vanilla Paste adds a well-rounded sweetness and deep, full-bodied flavor of vanilla to cakes, cookies, pies, and more. It can be used in a straight 1:1 ratio as a substitute for vanilla extract, for any recipe you’d like to make that much more vanilla-y, and makes an excellent ingredient for cocktails, milkshakes, and homemade coffee drinks.

organic-brown-rice-quinoa-fusilli-pasta-051524,Organic Brown Rice & Quinoa Fusilli Pasta," Though it’s known as an “ancient grain” (first consumed by humans around 3,500 years ago), quinoa rose steadily to its modern moment in the early 21st century, when restaurants started featuring this South American seed in a variety of dishes. Noticing the trend—and admiring the benefits of this gluten-free pseudo-grain—Trader Joe’s began developing products that feature quinoa, including our Organic Brown Rice & Quinoa Fusilli Pasta. Having been around for about a decade now, this Fusilli is still a hit with our customers, even for those who are not seeking a gluten-free option.   But what sets this Pasta apart from other gluten free noodles? Notably, our Organic Fusilli is made of 20% Quinoa. When we created it, similar gluten-free pastas only contained about 5% quinoa. We combined the Organic Quinoa with Organic Brown Rice, yielding a pasta product that is texturally tantalizing, and nutritionally interesting. Not only is it gluten, sodium, and sugar free, but each two-thirds cup serving delivers 4g of protein and 2g of fiber.   And the subtly nutty flavor pairs well with a variety of sauces and preparations. Enjoy it served hot, tossed with pasta sauce and grated Parmesan. Or make it the center of a chilled pasta salad with fresh Organic Basil, Campari tomatoes, olive oil, and several shakes of our Aglio Olio Seasoning Blend.

Dare we say, we did! Trader Joe’s Sweet & Salty Umami Crunchies Rice Crackers are made with Japonica rice, a short grain, non-glutinous varietal. Unlike our Mochi snacks, made from glutinous rice, the rice grains in these Crackers don’t break down into an entirely smooth paste. This difference contributes to the Cracker’s unique, craggy texture. These affectionately named Crunchies then get tossed in a Sweet & Salty glaze, made from soy sauce and sugar, that delivers some serious Umami in every bite (To those wheat intolerant folks who sighed at the words soy sauce, great news—the soy sauce in this snack is gluten free, made with rice, instead of wheat. Hooray!)   Snack on a handful of these Crunchies straight from the bag (more likely, two or three or four handfuls…), or add some serious depth to your salads by swapping your croutons with these Crackers instead.

In addition to the quality cut, the beef is all natural, meaning it comes from cows never treated with antibiotics, ever.   Because the slices are so thin, pieces of this Shaved Steak cook up very quickly—no need to worry about un- der- or overcooking! And its easy preparation might only be matched by its versatility. In the mood for stir fry? Shaved Steak makes the perfect protein addition. Fajitas? No problem. Beef soup on a cold day? Sure. Or maybe you’re far away from Philly, the cheesesteak capital.

But with cheeses such as Trader Joe’s Double Cream Gouda, additional cream is added to the already rich Hollander milk, creating one of the most luscious beginnings to a batch of cheese found in a turophile’s world.   A stunning Double Cream Gouda that is produced similarly to our other goudas, again, just with the supplementary cream added to the already rich pasteurized milk. Our supplier uses microbial enzymes making for a vegetarian friendly cheese and it’s colored using annatto to help achieve the cheese’s beautiful golden-orange color. The super high butterfat content - upwards of 60% - due to the added cream help make this cheese as decadent when snacked on by its lonesome as it is when melted into a hot dish in need of a cheesy companion. So grab a wedge for a number of melty meals or to tack on your next cheeseboard at your neighborhood Trader Joe’s.

feta-cheese-079858,Feta Cheese," Feta Cheese is undeniably one of the most famous cheeses produced across the world. As a matter of fact, feta cheese makes up approximately 70% of its homeland’s, Greece’s, total cheese consumption. This soft and pasteurized cow’s milk cheese is a salty, tangy, and unique offering, unmatched in the wide world of cheeses.   While across the feta world, each cheese maker may have minor differences in taste and texture, but on the whole, feta is a curd cheese that has a salty flavor and crumbly, grainy texture that is sometimes moistened by a salty brine once in its packaging. However, Trader Joe’s Feta Cheese isn’t packaged in a saline brine, making for a dry and tangy, but more neutral and less salty cheese than its brined siblings. Grab a package to bring a soft, sliceable cheese to your next charcuterie tray or Mediterranean-tinged meal!

Well, not a punch, per se, but a pleasant tartness that goes swing-for-swing with the sweetness. Sweet, meet sour. Sour, meet sweet.    Just how does our glorious Green Mango get its tangy twist? It’s pretty simple, actually. Our Thai supplier picks their mangoes early, before they’re ripe.

Like tofu, yuba is incredibly mild and takes on the flavor of whatever it’s cooked with, making Trader Joe’s Tofu Sheets the perfect protein to add to everything from curries and stir-fries to soups and stews.   Made for us in Malaysia, Trader Joe’s Tofu Sheets are the very same sheets used in our perennially popular Vegan Thai Green Curry. The Sheets come conveniently frozen; simply cut the corner of the pouch they come in, then heat it in the microwave for 21⁄2 minutes, and you’re ready to rock ‘n roll.

rice-vinegar-076721,Rice Vinegar," A true building block of many East Asian cuisines, the origins of rice vinegar date somewhere between four and five thousand years ago to ancient China. It’s traditionally made by fermenting rice wine, and over its long and storied history has been used as everything from a flavoring agent, to a preservative, to beverage in its own right. It comes in a variety of colors ranging from red, to white, to brown and black, and is sometimes seasoned with sugar or other flavorings. Trader Joe’s Rice Vinegar is styled after an everyday, unseasoned, white rice vinegar, but it’s certainly not lacking for flavor. Tart, tangy, and just a touch sweet, with a slightly sharp note for cutting through and brightening other flavors, it’s an ideal ingredient for adding to salad dressings, sauces, and marinades of all kinds. A bit of our Rice Vinegar will add an extra dimension of flavor to stir-fries, soups, and even just a freshly cooked pot of plain white rice. When mixed with soy sauce, it makes an excellent condiment for any of our gyoza or soup dumpling options, though we’ll leave the exact ratio to your personal tastes (some prefer equal parts soy sauce to Rice Vinegar, others enjoy two parts Vinegar to one part soy sauce). And when making quick pickles or a last-minute seaweed salad, our Rice Vinegar is nothing short of a must-have.

It’s wild-caught in the icy waters of the major Northeast Pacific fishing area located west of Canada and south of Alaska. Our supplier dry cures the Wild Sockeye then smokes it very slowly over applewood (from Washington state apple trees) at a relatively low temperature (below 85°F) to yield firm-textured fish with rich salmon flavor, and hints of smoke & salt.

We like to keep Trader Joe’s Whipped Cream Cheese on deck as a handy, creamy, and spreadable schmear for your bagels and toast as well as using it for a few baking applications over traditional style cream cheeses.   Cream cheese is a simple, yet classic culinary staple finding its way into many recipes, whether they may be for savory dinners or delightful desserts. Our suppliers begin with premium pasteurized milk and cream and use cheese cultures during a heating process to create a luscious creamed cheese. But where our Whipped Cream Cheese strays the traditional path is with the final step of whipping air into the cream cheese mixture and adding more milk for a lighter, fluffier texture. This makes it perfect for when you just need a spreadable addition to your brunch-time bagel or to make, say, a less dense cream cheese frosting for a summer-friendly carrot or banana cake.

cream-cheese-012491,Cream Cheese," A brick, or a block: what’s the difference? It seems like a negligible distinction, but we take such distinctions seriously—especially when it comes to Trader Joe’s Cream Cheese.   Within the cheese biz, this particular presentation of Cream Cheese is known as a “brick.” Brick, however, sounds heavy, and this creamy creation is anything but. Made for us using fresh milk and cream from cows not treated with rBST, it’s everything you want cream cheese to be—rich, creamy, and when softened, quite spread- able. So, rather than “brick,” we’d like to refer to our Cream Cheese as a “block,” as in “building block,” since it can be a building block in so many delicious dishes.   What’s that? You want examples? Sure. A simple appetizer idea: set it on a plate, top with salsa or sweet chili sauce and serve with tortilla chips or crackers for a Mexican or Thai inspired dip. How’s that for instant versa- tility? And speaking of dips, cream cheese is the star of any number of creamy dips. Don’t forget bagels—but how could you forget bagels? Perhaps our favorite usage for this particular building block is cheesecake. If you’re up to the challenge of making a cheesecake from scratch, you won’t find a better foundation.

apple-tatin-tartelettes-075252,Apple Tatin Tartelettes," Like so many of the world’s tastiest creations, the first tarte Tatin came about quite by accident. As the story goes, in setting out to make a traditional apple pie, an overworked French hotelier (a one Ms. Stéphanie Tatin, co-owner of the Hôtel Tatin) left her apples cooking in butter and sugar for far too long. To salvage her extra- caramelized endeavor, she placed a layer of pastry over the apples, popped the whole pan in the oven, and served the resulting dessert upside-down. Her guests loved this accidental apple pie-alternative so much that it became a fixture on the menu and, ultimately, rose to prominence all over France.   Accident or no accident, however, making a modern-day Apple Tatin from scratch is actually quite a tricky and time-consuming endeavor. Lucky for you, for a limited time, we’re doing the work for you—and we’re doing it well—with Trader Joe’s Apple Tatin Tartelettes! They’re made for us authentically in France, and they heat from frozen in just 15-20 minutes in the oven or 11⁄2-2 minutes in the microwave.

This approach concentrates and intensifies the traits derived from each country’s cocoa—which in our case includes cocoa from Venezuela, Vietnam, and Peru. What’s really special about these Chocolates is the opportunity to discern the differences in taste derived from the terroir of each unique location.   Tuck the sheer, elegant bag of 6 Milk Chocolate Batons into someone’s stocking, or gift it to all the chocolate connoisseurs in your life. Why not take advantage of the subtleties found in this Single Origin cocoa and use the Batons to conduct an after-the-meal tasting at your next holiday dinner party.

Some backstory: way back in 2013 (Happy 10th Anniversary, Dark Chocolate Peppermint Cremes!), we set out to create a cool, creamy, chocolate-covered, peppermint-flavored candy with a craftily crunchy twist—and the result was an instant TJ’s candy-aisle classic. Mission accomplished. Each Creme is comprised of three key components: a sweet, creamy Peppermint filling, a smooth Dark Chocolate coating, and a sprinkle of crushed candy cane pieces on top, bringing an extra hit of mint and a pleasantly unexpected crunch.

Much like a musical rondo, Trader Joe’s Dark Chocolate Rondos are all about balance: the bracing tartness of the dried Raspberry, Strawberry, and Cherry cuts through the richness of the Dark Chocolate to create a delicious duet of flavor within every elegant bite.

So, it was only a matter of time before we used a little Aristotelian logic to determine that Blue Cheese is delicious, and Chalkidiki Olives are delicious, therefore Blue Cheese Stuffed Chalkidiki Olives will be doubly delicious.    Our supplier in Greece takes generously-sized, exceptionally firm Chalkidiki Olives, stuffs them with a creamy, bold and tangy Blue Cheese spread (which includes a bit of salty mizithra cheese), then packs them in a blend of sunflower and extra virgin olive oils. Each jar of these loaded orbs is like a present waiting to be unpacked. Great for gift baskets and ideal for cocktail parties, Trader Joe’s Blue Cheese Stuffed Chalkidiki Olives will make any martini enthusiast’s day. Truth be told, we simply like to snack on them.

Some are everyday all-stars, and some are limited, seasonal sensations, like Trader Joe’s Figgy Cheddar that’s here just for the holidays.   This mild Cheddar is produced for us in Leicestershire, UK, in the heart of the Vale of Belvoir, to be precise. Mini Spanish Figs are marinated in white wine, rum, and a blend of warming spices— like coriander, cinnamon, ginger, fennel, nutmeg, and cloves—then mixed right into the cheese. The result is a creamy, mild Cheddar, studded with marinated Fig pieces. It makes a wonderful addition to a cheeseboard and is superb for snacking. If you’ve ever had apple pie with a slice of Cheddar on top, consider serving with a slice of this Cheddar instead.

This will help tame the aroma and the texture will soften to an incredibly creamy consistency.

So, what better way could there be to make those moments even sweeter, than with some sweet, pleasantly cinnamon-spiced sugar? That’s precisely what Trader Joe’s Cinnamon Swizzle Sticks offer, while employing a rather ingenious delivery system to do so: they’re made by rolling whole sticks of cinnamon in crunchy rock sugar. When used as a stirring stick (or simply as a festive garnish) for a warm, wintry beverage, they gently sweeten your drink as they dissolve, eventually leaving you a chewy, cinnamon-candy treat to eat right off the cinnamon.   In addition to adding some fun, festive flair to your everyday cup of joe, Trader Joe’s Cinnamon Swizzle Sticks make a great gift for the holiday season, especially for folks on your list with a sweet tooth and a penchant for warm, winter-seasonal beverages.

In a fit of inspiration, we took these familiar and beloved flavors, and put them together into one candy. To accomplish this, we engaged some expert trufflers in the U.K., just outside of London. Using time-tested methods, they first craft world-class, sea-salt caramel, then add cinnamon, creating a gooey, cinnamon-y, sea-salty delight. That mixture is carefully deposited into very thin milk chocolate shells that are rolled in powdered sugar for a festive, wintry look—inspired by snowballs, of course!

empanadas-de-ropa-vieja-076647,Empanadas de Ropa Vieja," Ropa vieja is a much-adored entrée, globally, with variations in a multitude of cultures across the Americas, the Iberian Peninsula, and the Philippines. It’s particularly treasured within the culinary canon of Cuba, where it is celebrated as the country’s national dish. So named for its resemblance to old, torn-up clothing, the Cuban version of ropa vieja is typically made with shredded beef stewed in a rich, tomato-based sauce, along with onions, bell peppers and a savory suite of satisfyingly zesty spices. That’s the approach our supplier in Florida— the capital of Cuban cuisine within the U.S., we might add—takes with Trader Joe’s Empanadas de Ropa Vieja, which recontextualizes this classic dish into the cozy confines of a crisp, cassava-based pastry crust.   And since our supplier has done all that work for you, all you need to do to enjoy these estimable Empanadas is heat them, from frozen, in your oven for about 15 minutes, or your air fryer for about 10. From there, you’re free to enjoy them as an effortless appetizer along with your favorite dipping sauce—we find that their rich, hearty flavor and mix of tender and crispy textures take especially well to the herby, slightly spicy notes of our Chimichurri Sauce, for instance.

aged-sheeps-milk-cheese-marinated-in-evoo-076963,Aged Sheep's Milk Cheese Marinated in EVOO," No need to be sheepish about it: Trader Joe’s Aged Sheep’s Milk Cheese stands out from the rest of the flock—and not just because the fresh Sheep’s Milk is sourced from some of the finest dairy farms in Toledo, Spain. Each block is also marinated in aromatic, PDO Cornicabra Extra Virgin Olive Oil, and Aged between three and five months to further develop its characteristic flavor. (Fun fact: cornicabra means “goat’s horn,” as the olives used to produce this revered oil are oval-shaped, with a small horn on one side.) The oil lends a robust, pleasantly bitter flavor and green, grassy aromas, that produce a particularly unique and delicious eating experience when paired with the mild, nutty flavors of the Aged Sheep’s Milk Cheese.   Serve this firm-yet-creamy Cheese as an appetizer before the big meal, alongside a bowl of Nuts About Rosemary Mix and juicy Honeycrisp apple slices. Or let a freshly toasted Ciabatta Roll soak up the olive oil as the Cheese accompanies an array of leftovers in sandwich form.

fully-cooked-spiral-sliced-uncured-half-ham-075337,Fully Cooked Spiral Sliced Uncured Half Ham," We recognize that not all of our customers prefer turkey when it comes to the big, holiday meal. For these folks, we offer Spiral Sliced Uncured Ham. Like our Turkeys, these Hams come with a whole host of attractive attributes. They are 100% antibiotic-free and come from crate-free, vegetarian-fed pigs that have never been given hormones. They’re considered Uncured because they contain no added nitrates or nitries, except what’s naturally present in celery and sea salt.    Unlike our Turkeys, our Hams are fully cooked and conveniently Spiral Sliced, which allows the meat to stay on the bone until you remove it with the simple twist of a fork. They require no seasoning, no stuffing, no basting—and almost no prep. Simply unwrap the Ham, place it on a tray or roasting pan, and heat it in a 275°F oven, ready to enjoy in just about two hours.    And though you definitely don’t have to do anything to the Ham when it's in the oven, we’ve included an optional spiced glaze for those who still miss the basting!  ","['Food', 'Meat, Seafood & Plant-based', 'Beef, Pork & Lamb']",https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/fully-cooked-spiral-sliced-uncured-half-ham-075337,$5.99,1 Lb,https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m20801/75337.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280,Antibiotic Free,"['UNCURED HAM PREPARED WITH: WATER', 'CONTAINS 2% OR LESS OF SALT', 'VINEGAR', 'TURBINADO SUGAR', 'CULTURED CELERY POWDER', 'CHERRY POWDER', 'GLAZE PACKET INGREDIENTS: CANE SUGAR, SPICES, CANOLA OIL.']",,"['Effortless Entertaining', 'Fall Faves', 'Family Style', 'Merry-making', 'Time-pressed']",['3 oz glazed ham(84g)'],['130 ']

Our Chicago-based salumist starts with heritage-breed, crate-free pork (which means the animals were not restrained in gestation or farrowing crates), raised without the use of added hormones or antibiotics. They combine this flavorful, high-quality pork with Lambrusco red wine, Sicilian sea salt, piquant black pepper, and toasted, ground fennel seeds to create the fragrant Finocchiona profile, commonly found in salumerias throughout the Italian region of Tuscany. What’s more, this Salami is Uncured, containing no added nitrates or nitrites, except what’s naturally present in celery and sea salt. Benissimo!   To serve this Finocchiona Uncured Salami, slit the inedible casing with a knife along the base, then lengthwise, and peel the casing to expose only the portion you’d like to eat. For the ultimate Tuscan countryside experience, we recommend slicing it on the bias and presenting it on a board with thinly sliced TJ’s Pecorino Romano and fresh Fennel, and a glass of fruit-forward red wine, like Ruggero Di Bardo Susumaniello.

Unlike Mexican style chorizo, which is typically raw and needs to be cooked before eating (like TJ’s Soy Chorizo), Spanish Style Chorizo is more like a typical salami, ready to eat right out of the package.   To make this Spanish Style Chorizo, our Chicago supplier starts with heritage-breed pork, with no added hormones, and no antibiotics, ever. It’s also crate-free pork, which means the animals were not restrained in gestation and farrowing crates. The recipe—which includes red wine, sea salt, black pepper, and smoked paprika—provides an eating experience beyond typical salami. In particular, the richness of the red wine, and the hint of smoke from the paprika give this Chorizo a one-of-a-kind profile.

Trader Joe’s Italian Black Summer Truffle Slices in Olive Oil, for example, excel at adding a remarkable depth of umami-forward flavor and alluring, truffle aromas to the kinds of hearty pastas, creamy soups, and roasted proteins that define wintertime comfort food. Exclusively available during the winter season, this tasty take on a classic carpaccio di tartufo has plenty to offer for fans of rich truffle flavor—and all for a fraction of the price you’d pay elsewhere.   Our supplier in Italy packs these razor-thin, texturally delicate slices of Black Summer Truffle in pure, relatively mild Olive Oil, rather than EVOO, which helps keep the truffle flavor front and center. They can be added directly from the jar to everything from pizza to pan-seared salmon, omelets to avocado toast, or breaded chicken cutlets to bubbly, béchamel-based lasagnas. They make an excellent gift option for any truffle-fervent foodies on your list, as well as an able accompaniment to a charcuterie board during a romantic dinner date at home. Just be sure to pick up a jar before winter’s end—supplise are limited, and at this price, these Truffle Slices in Olive Oil won’t stay on the shelves for too long!

That’s where your neighborhood Trader Joe’s comes in, in general, and with Braised Pork Shoulder in a Fig & Apricot Sauce, in particular.   Cooked sous vide (that is, cooked vacuum-sealed in a warm water bath) for more than 12 hours, this mouthwateringly moist Pork Shoulder takes the guesswork out of main dish musings with aplomb. It’s covered in a sweetly complex Fig & Apricot Sauce, its tangy stone fruit and balsamic flavors deftly complementing the savory garlic and onion, all of which elevate the Pork Shoulder to new heights. With notes of black pepper and coriander, it’s well-paired with a glass of spice-forward Pontificis GSM. Perhaps most impressively, it manages to be exceedingly tender without falling apart, allowing you to slice and serve it as an effortlessly fancy focal point on a plate of fluffy mashed potatoes and crisp salad greens. Dinner is served, indeed!   Averaging about 1.5 pounds in size, Trader Joe’s Braised Pork Shoulder in a Fig & Apricot Sauce heats in a 350°F oven in about 20 minutes—and if time is of the essence, you can microwave it in about eight minutes. You might be thinking, “Braised Pork Shoulder that’s ready to eat, in just eight minutes?

organic-farfalle-rigate-pasta-075723,Organic Farfalle Rigate Pasta," Named after the Italian word for “butterflies”, and also known in other parts of Italy as strichetti (“bow ties”), Farfalle are far and away one of our very favorite pasta shapes. While their resemblance to pollinators and pieces of neckwear is certainly charming, they also serve a purpose beyond simple aesthetics: both the ruffled edges of the “wings” and the pinched point in the middle help each piece of Farfalle hold on to sauces and oils, and thus deliver more flavor with every bite. Made for us by the same expert Italian pasta manufacturer as many of our celebrated, limited-run, organic pastas, Trader Joe’s Organic Farfalle Rigate takes this design philosophy one step further, via the introduction of radiating ridges (hence, “Rigate”) on every piece.   In addition to providing an even more satisfyingly toothsome texture (especially when cooked al dente), these ridges also make their bronze-die-cut Farfalle Rigate that much better at holding our Basil Pesto, Creamy Tomato Basil Pasta Sauce, or any other pasta sauce you choose to toss them in. While we find that they’re especially suited for richer, creamier sauces, the truth is, you really can’t go wrong with Farfalle of this quality. Even just a bit of your favorite TJ’s olive oil, minced garlic, and crushed red chili peppers will make a fantastic Farfalle aglio e olio. Just be sure to pick up a package while you can: supplies are limited, and we wouldn’t be at all surprised if these Organic Farfalle fly off the shelves before too long.

We already have an awesome Vanilla Overnight Oats option featuring oats that are soaked in an almond beverage, so for our latest everyday flavor, Peanut Butter Overnight Oats made all of the deliciously nutty sense in the world...   A simple, toothsome blend of gluten free rolled oats, water, peanut butter, partially defatted peanut flour, dates, and a dash of salt, Trade Joe’s Peanut Butter Overnight Oats make for an excellent morning meal-on-the-go or an easy, hearty-in-a-hurry afternoon snack, and they’re a tasty way to refuel after a workout.

veggies-greens-salad-kit-060984,Veggies & Greens Salad Kit," A few words of explanation… At Trader Joe’s, we’re known for the clever, creative names we come up with for our products…well, some of our products. We thought we’d take a moment to explain what we mean by “Veggies and Greens Salad Kit.” “Veggies” is short for vegetables, and “Greens” is a common way to refer to different forms of lettuce, which are technically leaf vegetables. So, this could have been called “Veggies and Veggies Salad Kit,” but then we would lose the familiar comfort of using a colloquialism like “greens.” We decided to go with “Veggies and Greens Salad.”   Trader Joe’s Veggies and Greens Salad Kit is a combination of chopped broccoli, shaved cauliflower, shaved Brussels sprouts, radicchio, green cabbage, and kale. Since this is a complete salad kit, these vegetables are ac- companied by pistachios, dried pear crumbles, and a honey ginger dressing to create a salad that’s expectedly healthy and delightfully delicious without being too self-righteous.   Terrific on its own, or as a side dish, this Salad has Asian-influenced flavors that go well with all sorts of main entrées, like Garlic Peppercorn Pork Tenderloin, broiled chicken, or salmon. It’s also a unique way to serve cruciferous veggies throughout their peak season.

ciabatta-rolls-097438,Ciabatta Rolls," Not so very long ago, in 1982, a man in Verona, Italy invented ciabatta bread. He decided the loaf looked quite like his wife’s slippers (the English translation of ciabatta), and so bread named after footwear was born. Even more recently, we decided to start selling such bread, like Trader Joe’s Ciabatta Rolls (even though these are more like miniature slippers).   Ciabatta dough contains a high moisture content—over 70% in this case—giving it a thin, slightly caramel- ized crust and a light crumb with large holes. Better yet, it’s made with just a few ingredients: unbleached wheat flour, water, sea salt, yeast, and malted barley. Though our supplier makes large quantities of bread, they are still able to achieve the sought-after artisanal taste and texture. And, really, what’s more artisan than miniature versions of an esteemed artisan bread?   Dip these tasty rolls to your heart’s content, perhaps in Sicilian Selezione Extra Virgin Olive Oil and Balsamic Vinegar of Modena. Make little panini sandwiches with mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil. Or, go the traditional route: use it to soak up extra sauce after a heaping bowl of spaghetti—ciabatta is famous for its ability to be dipped without falling apart. For a crispy crust, place the bread in a 400˚F oven for a few minutes.

Whether oozing off of a slice of pizza or layered in a pan of lasagna, Trader Joe’s Shredded Mozzarella Cheese is ready to include in many dishes for a melted, stringy, and flavorful cheese addition. Our mozzarella fior di latte, the Italian terminology for cow’s milk mozzarella, is made with pasteurized part-skim milk, cheese cultures, microbial enzymes, and just a few other preservative ingredients. Pasta filata, again, an Italian term, but this time for the mozz making process, is as simple as starting with fresh whey and cheese cultures, adding the microbial enzymes, and then heating in water to form a stringy and elastic cheese that can be kneaded and then shredded; ready for you to sprinkle and melt on whatever you’d like!

Our newest almond-powered addition to said section, Trader Joe’s Garlic & Black Pepper Almonds, deftly demonstrates why: by adding just a simple suite of savory seasonings (black pepper, sea salt, and dehydrated garlic and onion), these crunchy, well-roasted Almonds take on a whole new dimension of flavor, offering alluring, allium aromatics and a subtle, yet satisfying, level of spice.   An ideal addition to any cheese plate, charcuterie board, or cocktail party snack table, Trader Joe’s Garlic & Black Pepper Almonds also make a superb snack for simply enjoying by the handful, anytime you might feel peckish. Enjoy them as a movie snack, a treat for the whole table at a board game night, or as a crunchy companion to an ice-cold beer.

avocado-ranch-salad-kit-072567,Avocado Ranch Salad Kit," When we set out to create one of our all-in-one salad kits, sometimes it comes down to simply testing out a theory. For example: just on a conceptual level alone, the mild, lightly grassy flavor and remarkably creamy texture of avocado should make it a natural companion to the savory, herby sensations of a classic ranch dressing. We put that theory into practice with Trader Joe’s Avocado Ranch Salad Kit, by compiling a collection of fresh, crisp, shredded leafy greens and veggies, savory, grated Cheddar, and crunchy, lightly salted corn chips to act as a canvas for a captivaingly creamy ranch dressing made with a base of buttermilk and avocados. As it turns out, that theory was delightfully, deliciously correct. Don’t you just love the scientific method?   Like all our salad kits, this Avocado Ranch is a super quick and convenient way to add a side salad to practically any meal. It’s a proven winner with pizza, a beauty with barbecue, and a certified sensation, even with something as simple as a sandwich. Or, if you’d prefer it as an entrée, just pop your favorite protein on top, an voilà—you’ve got a whole meal on your hands.

Made with a base of wheat flour, sugar, and butter—All Butter, in fact!— eggs are included to bind the Dough and lend it a pale yellow hue, while leavening ensures proper puffiness in every bake. Vanilla extract and a touch of sea salt round out the buttery, pleasantly sweet flavor of this delightful, All-Butter Dough, and it’s packaged in a versatile tube shape, which allows for consistent sizing when slicing or portioning. Bake slices to your preferred texture (go with a shorter bake for soft & chewy, or longer for light & crisp) and enjoy their tasty, sugar-cookie-meets-shortbread simplicity as-is, or coat them in cinnamon and sugar before baking for an aromatic boost of sweetness. You might wrap a piece of Dough around a Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup and bake for a sweet surprise, or roll it flat and break out the cookie cutters for an edible art project. (Pro-tip: for easier rolling, let the Dough sit 10-15 minutes at room temperature first.)

wicked-good-mini-chocolate-bars-074622,Wicked Good Mini Chocolate Bars," According to historians, trick-or-treating traces its origins to a 16th-century custom in Scotland and Ireland known as “guising.” Back then, children (and a few adults) would don costumes and go to door-to-door asking for fruit, baked goods, or money in exchange for reciting poetry (an aspect we are, arguably, spared from in the modern era). While it wasn’t until the early 20th century that the practice and the phrase “trick or treat” were popularized in North America, it’s clear that the desire to give and get candy on a chilly autumn night has been with us for a long, long time. Which is precisely why we’re proud to finally get in on the game with Trader Joe’s Wicked Good Mini Chocolate Bars!

They’re individually wrapped, so they’re easy to hand out to trick-or-treaters on Halloween, or take a few with you wherever you need to go.

All together, this sublimely simple recipe results in super smooth and satisfying salsa that’s great for dipping with chips, mixing into sauces, or spooning over pretty much anything you can think of.   Seriously: try it on homemade nachos, atop a burger, drizzled over a brown rice bowl with seared salmon and roasted broccolini...Guacasalsa will bring a burst of bright, lightly spicy flavor to them all. When it comes to dipping, feel free to think beyond chips, too: we love them with pupusas, crispy empanadas, French fries and tater tots, or our Buffalo Style Chicken Poppers.

coconut-water-076006,Coconut Water," The quality of any coconut beverage is entirely dependent upon the quality of the coconut. Fortunately for folks who go nuts for the stuff (as many of you do), Trader Joe’s Coconut Water is extracted from only the finest of coconuts, grown on coconut farms in Brazil where the reliably warm climate lends itself to a year-round harvest. The coconuts are plucked and drained of their water, then the water—i.e., the Coconut Water—is pasteurized and blended with a bit of vitamin C to help maintain its natural color.   The whole thing is a simple process, really—so when you pluck a carton of Trader Joe’s Coconut Water from our shelves and crack it open, it’s easy to picture yourself sipping the stuff straight from the source. Its potassium content (about 980mg, or 20% of the recommended daily value, per carton) and convenient, grab-and-go- format make it an excellent option for post-workout rehydration. It also adds some subtle, coconutty flavor to smoothies and mixed drinks. And here’s a #ProTip: no matter how you choose to enjoy it, we recommend chilling our shelf-stable-until-open Coconut Water in the fridge and shaking it well before serving. Cheers!

Within a few days of being plucked, the coconuts are drained of their “water,” which is then pasteurized and packaged with less than 1% fructose and ascorbic acid. Fructose is a natural fruit sugar already in coconut. Adding a little more helps balance the brix count (and therefore the flavor), which can vary seasonally.

organic-seedy-crackers-075752,Organic Seedy Crackers," Having taste-tested quite a few crackers in our time, we can tell you that the most crucial aspect of a cracker is usually how satisfying its crunch is. For example, while our Trader Joe’s Organic Seedy Crackers are tremendously savory and delightfully hearty, what really sets them apart is their remarkably resonant crunch. What’s our supplier’s secret? Making each Cracker primarily from the kinds of crispy seeds and grains that tend to play a supporting role in other crackers. Starting with a base of organic brown rice, our supplier mixes in organic quinoa, flax, and sesame seeds into each batch, then flavors them with a bit of umami-forward tamari before baking, resulting in one captivatingly crunchy (and gloriously gluten-free!) Cracker.   Excellent as an anytime snack, and an ideal inclusion in school lunches, our vegan and kosher (pareve) Organic Seedy Crackers especially excel when used as a vehicle for cheeses, charcuterie, or dips. We find that their superlatively crisp texture and light umami edge make them particularly suited for pairing with rich, creamy fare. Try them with a bit of Ricotta and Olive Tapenade, a slice of avocado and Lightly Smoked Salmon in Olive Oil, or, to keep things vegan, a simple spread of Dairy-Free Garlic & Herbs Boursin.

And in the interests of adding even more elegance to your eating experience, we now offer Trader Joe’s Organic Red Butter Lettuce in our produce section.

In need of a quick side salad with dinner? Our Organic Red Butter Lettuce is a convenient (and cost-effective) choice: simply toss with your favorite salad dressing (we find something creamy like our Organic Italian Dressing pairs particularly well this Lettuce’s super soft bite), a few halved cherry tomatoes, and something crunchy like Candied Pecans or Rosemary Croissant Croutons, and voilà!

A cruciferous cultivar within the same species of brassica that includes bok choy, field mustard, and turnips (who knew?), Napa Cabbage is adored across the globe for its mild, subtly sweet flavor and tender texture. We adore it so much, in fact, that we now carry Napa Cabbage, pre-washed and Cut into ready-to-cook segments, as part of our everyday produce offerings. Cooking with Napa has never been easier!   Try adding Trader Joe’s Cut Napa Cabbage into soups, stews, and stir-fries—we find its flavor profile takes especially well to savory, umami, and spicy seasonings. The more substantial segments can be enjoyed raw as a scoop for dips, while the lighter, leafier cuts make a great base for a salad, or shredded into a slaw and tossed with our Organic Toasted Sesame Dressing. And for a particularly easy entrée, simply sauté a handful with some thinly sliced garlic and a few dashes of our Organic Coconut Aminos, then serve over a plate of Squiggly Knife Cut Style Noodles and your favorite protein.

In other words, it’s like a love letter to all things balsamic and black truffle, conveniently contained in one bottle.   So, how best to enjoy Trader Joe’s Truffle Glaze? We recommend applying a light drizzle on your favorite savory staples, like grilled salmon, a slice of Pizza Margherita, a freshy seared steak, or a plate of our Italian Tomato & Burrata Raviolini. It makes an excellent ingredient for a full-flavored salad dressing, especially if the salad it’s being used on contains bitter greens like shaved Belgian Endives, and turns a commonplace caprese into a truffle-y triumph.

bbq-seasoned-spatchcocked-chicken-058881,BBQ Seasoned Spatchcocked Chicken," Prepped and ready to cook right away, TJ’s BBQ Seasoned Spatchcocked Chicken comes pre-spatchcocked (that is to say, butterflied and flattened) and marinated in a mix of apple juice, maple syrup, honey, mustard and coffee, along with a tasty blend of peppery BBQ seasonings. Since the Chicken is flattened, and thus has more surface area, it will both cook more quickly, and retain more moisture through the cooking process than your everyday, non-butterflied bird. In other words, this chicken may be flat, but its flavors are anything but.   To prepare, simply remove the BBQ Seasoned Spatchocked Chicken from the bag and place it skin-side up on a pre-heated grill until well-browned and its internal temperature reaches 165°F on a meat thermometer. Or, lay it skin-side up in a shallow baking dish and cook at 375oF for about an hour. (Cooking time varies according to the size of your bird.) That’s it! Serve with some TJ’s Old Fashioned Potato Salad, whip up a TJ’s Organic Coleslaw Kit and heat up some Organic Baked Beans, and you’ve got an easy, complete, classic BBQ dinner for four.

Since chicken thighs have a relatively higher fat content, they’re typically more juicy and flavorful from the start, which tends to create all the more exciting interactions with other flavors. Case in point: Trader Joe’s Savory Herbed Chicken Thighs. Each package contains boneless, skinless cuts of Chicken Thigh that have been seasoned with a sublimely savory marinade that’s made with aromatic herbs like basil, cilantro, and mint, along with garlic, shredded lemon peel, crushed chili peppers, and even a bit of fish sauce for an extra umami kick.   This mix of bold herbs, seasonings, and aromatics, combined with the natural juiciness and richness of the Chicken Thighs, creates a uniquely delicious flavor profile once they’re fully cooked. Speaking of which, since they’re pre-marinated and ready to go, cooking is a breeze: simply grill, roast, or pan-fry until a thermometer in their internal temperature reads 165°F on a meat thermometer. After that, it’s simply a matter of picking a side to serve them with: we like them with a bit of Organic Cauliflower Rice, some steamed veggies, or a fully-loaded baked potato, ourselves.

If you ask us, it comes down to a very simple aspect of our salad-selecting philosophy: we only bring in the kinds of salads that we would want to eat on our lunch breaks, too. Trader Joe’s Sesame Miso Salad with Salmon is a prime example of this philosophy in action. Inspired by the kinds of salmon-topped entrée salads you might find at a higher-end restaurant, each one starts with a blend of crisp, leafy greens like romaine, frisée, and baby spinach, to which our supplier adds shredded red cabbage and carrots, diced cucumbers, sliced green onions, and well-seasoned, flaky, grilled salmon. They also include a packet of crispy-fried onion pieces for a pop of texture, and a super flavorful sesame miso dressing to tie it all together.   Once tossed, this Sesame Miso Salad wth Salmon offers a captivating complex mix of textures and flavors, from the light, leafy elegance of the spring mix, to the tender richness of the salmon, and especially in the combination of umami, spice, and sweetness in the dressing. An excellent option for an easy lunch or dinner, we recommend enjoying this Salad with something sweet and fizzy, like a Sparkling Green Tea with Pineapple Juice Beverage. And if you happen to enjoy it during dinner hours, a chilled glass of Mbali Chenin Viognier will make an even more pleasant pairing.

green-goddess-salad-077429,Green Goddess Salad," People don’t always think of Trader Joe’s as a “grab-n-go” store, but perhaps they should. For those who have discovered our ready-to-eat salads, last-minute lunch is as easy as a quick trip to your neighborhood store. Made fresh every day, our salads come with a wide variety of veggies, proteins, dressings, and crunchy accoutrements. Trader Joe’s Green Goddess Salad fits right into this section, with an attractive collection of textures & flavors.   The colorful base is made up of shredded veggies, including romaine lettuce, spinach, red cabbage, and carrots. The Salad is protein-powered by Chicken Thigh Meat that’s been seasoned with a blend of savory spices, then Blackened and cut into bite-sized pieces. When you’re ready for lunch, simply open the included packet of crispy red rice and add it to the Salad for an impressive, crunchy contrast to the tender Chicken. Then add as much of the Green Goddess Ranch Dressing as you like. The blend of creamy buttermilk, champagne vinegar, tangy lemon, plus a host of herbs (parsley, basil, green onion, and chives), is a divine way to dress this Salad. And don’t forget a squeeze of the fresh lime wedge that’s included!   And if it’s dinner time, you’ll likely find that Trader Joe’s Green Goddess Salad is substantial enough to fill you up... but if you’re feeling famished, a side of TJ’s Tomato & Parmesan Focaccia from our “grab-n-go” bakery section will complement this Salad’s profile, and ensure you’re completely satisfied!

Our Sri Lankan supplier starts with organically-grown King Coconut. As true “coconut scientists,” these experts know how to press shredded coconut meat at different stages and blend the resulting milks to create the exact flavor profile we are looking for. It’s a clean coconutty flavor, with a mild coconut aroma. The texture is smooth and milky—not to too thick or too thin. Amazingly, they’ve achieved this texture without the use of thickeners or gums—additives that are present in most of the other coconut milk brands you’ll find in the marketplace. The only thing added to our Coconut Milk is a small amount of filtered water that helps to balance the fat content.   Cook with it—our Organic Coconut Milk is excellent in curries.

Trader Joe’s Brigadeiros are made for us in Portugal, where they’re also a treasured confection. Our authentic recipe includes sweetened condensed milk, cream, cocoa, and cultured butter.

But you may ask: why the name?   Brigadeiros were first popularized during the Brazilian presidential election of 1945, when Brazilian women (who just recently had gained the right to vote), made mounds & mounds of these bonbons and sold them in support of their candidate, Brigadier Eduardo Gomes. While Gomes lost the election, one might say that the rest of the country still won, as the popularity of “brigadier’s candy” proliferated.

Baked ricotta in particular is a creamy, cheesy canvas that’s ripe for seasonal interpretations of all sorts—like our latest rendition for fall, Trader Joe’s Baked Sheep’s Milk Ricotta Cheese with Herbs de Provence. (Side note: if you haven’t tried the Baked Lemon Ricotta Cheese on offer during the holidays, make this your year!)   To craft this one-of-a-kind Ricotta, our Sicilian supplier starts with a base blend of sheep’s whey, sheep’s milk, and salt. The resulting curd is seasoned with Herbs de Provence—specifically, rosemary, oregano, savory, thyme, and basil—then placed into a circular mold and baked at low temperatures.

spatchcocked-sweet-savory-chicken-075150,Spatchcocked Sweet & Savory Chicken," Likely derived from a combination of the 16th century Irish term “spitchcock” (the practice of splitting an eel down the middle before roasting or frying it) and a punny reference to “dispatching the cock” (i.e., cooking a chicken rather quickly), we find that saying the word “spatchcock” is a lot more fun than the actual act of spatchcocking a chicken, itself. Which is precisely we we’re such fans of our pre-marinaded, pre-butterflied, rarin’-and-ready-to-cook chicken, like our newest variation, Trader Joe’s Spatchcocked Sweet & Savory Chicken. Made with an autumnally-inspired mix of sweet maple syrup and tangy Dijon mustard, our supplier has taken all the prep work out of this poultry, leaving you with just two simple tasks: Cook, and enjoy.   And since each Chicken comes pre-Spatchcocked (which is to say, split open at the breastbone and flattened), even the cooking process is much simpler, too. Just place it skin side up in a shallow baking pan and roast at 350°F for 45-50 minutes for a perfectly evenly cooked, beautifully browned bird. Once cooked, the sweet and savory seasoning will caramelize wonderfully, making it a phenomenally flavorful center-of-the-plate option. Grab a few sides, like our Sweet Kale & Broccoli Slaw and Country Potatoes with Haricots Verts & Mushrooms, and just like that, dinner is ready.

There’s just something about its deep, rich sweetness that gives us that all-round autumn-y feeling. And what better way could there be to celebrate this maple-induced nuttiness than with Trader Joe’s Maple Spiced Nut Mix? Available only during the fall season, this magnificent mélange includes almonds and pecans that have both been coated in a buttery maple rosemary glaze, along with crisp pepitas for some complementary crunch, and sweetened dried cranberries to provide an element of tartness to tie everything together.   Sweet, crunchy, and with just a touch of heat and rosemary-tinged herbaceous notes, every bite of our Maple Spiced Nut Mix evokes the essence of autumn. Enjoy a handful while watching a spooky (or not-so-spooky!) movie, sipping an appropriately autumnal cocktail, or simply enjoying a brisk, blustery, weekend afternoon.

double-fold-bourbon-vanilla-extract-076665,Double Fold Bourbon Vanilla Extract," All too often, “vanilla” is considered the default flavor—the boring, mundane choice at the ice cream parlor. In reality, vanilla is a rapturously rich and utterly unique flavor. Sweet, warm, and enchantingly floral, there’s a reason that vanilla is such a ubiquitous inclusion in baked goods and sweet treats—it’s simply very good at making desserts, and even savory dishes, taste better. That’s why, starting now through the end of the holiday season, we’re proud to offer Trader Joe’s Double Fold Vanilla Extract. Using Madagascar-grown vanilla beans (which, like all natural vanilla, are actually the seed pods of a tropical orchid ), our supplier makes each batch with twice the amount of vanilla as a standard strength extract (hence, Double Fold.) They then further fortify it with Vanilla Bean Seeds, resulting in a pleasantly potent Vanilla Extract that provides an impressive pop of vanilla flavor to cakes, pies, cookies, sauces, cocktails, and everything in between.   With its elegantly-styled, long-necked bottle and charming cork stopper, Trader Joe’s Double Fold Vanilla Extract with Vanilla Bean Seeds is an apt and attractive addition to any pantry, and makes an ideal gift for home bakers of all experience levels. Perhaps some stores would be content enough with these estimable aesthetic and culinary qualities, but since this is Trader Joe’s, we’ve gone the additional step of making its value exceptional, too: while supplies last, you can pick up of a bottle of our Double Fold Vanilla Extract for a fraction of the price you’d pay for extracts of similar quality elsewhere.

delice-de-jenlain-semi-soft-cheese-070918,Délice de Jenlain Semi-soft Cheese," Tucked away in the northern edge of France, just a mile or two from the Belgian border, the quiet commune of Jenlain is home to Brasserie Duyck, the world’s most preeminent producer of beers in the Bière de Garde style. Characterized by rich malts and enticingly tart notes, Jenlain beers pair particularly well with soft, ripe cheeses, a fact that serves as the inspiration for this tour de force of fromage. Starting with a base of creamy, semisoft cheese, our supplier washes the rind with a generous amount of Jenlain beer, which imparts a light earthiness and faint caramel note throughout. They call it Délice de Jenlain: we call it an essential entry into the Spotlight Cheese series.   Just like the beer that gives it its name and distinctive flavor, Trader Joe’s Délice de Jenlain is delightfully rustic, elegantly delicious, and uniquely French. With its characteristically profound aroma, well-rounded texture and well-balanced flavor profile, marked by subtly sweet notes of malt and yeast, it makes a welcome addition to any cheese plate or charcuterie board, and an especially apt hors d’oeuvre for a cocktail party.

shrimp-garlic-flatbread-075067,Shrimp & Garlic Flatbread," Maybe it’s chemistry, maybe it’s biology, maybe it’s some grand, unfathomable cosmic connection, but there’s just something about the combination of shrimp, garlic, and a creamy sauce that makes it seem as though all three were made for one another. Time and time again, in curries, pastas, and chowders, these three powerhouses of flavor form something even greater than the already-formidable sum of their parts. And now, in Trader Joe’s Shrimp & Garlic Flatbread, this tremendous trio takes their talents in a crisp, cheesy, decidedly pizza-esque direction.   Each Flatbread starts with a light and thin rectangular crust, to which our supplier adds a rich, garlic-butter béchamel sauce that’s been seasoned with white pepper and curry powder, aromatic herbs like chives and parsley, as well as orange and lemon zest for a bit of balancing acidity. Next, they add savory and slightly umami-tinged grated Parmesan, and de-shelled, tail-off Shrimp to complete the picture. Once cooked in your home oven (18-20 minutes at 475°F, from frozen, ought to do the trick) this Flatbread makes an easy and delicious appetizer or entrée: we recommend pairing it with an Organic Caesar Salad to make it a complete meal, and a glass of crisp white wine to make the most of its classic creamy garlic & shrimp combo.

mango-blueberry-chia-bowl-075233,Mango Blueberry Chia Bowl," Starting your morning with a bowl of fruit is a sure-fire way to make your day that much brighter (and sweeter, and tangier—depending on the fruit, of course). That’s why we’re such big fans of Trader Joe’s Mango Blueberry Chia Bowl. Made with an ingredient deck that’s exclusively fruit, fruit juice, chia seeds, and water, each bowl starts with a base of tangy mango purée that’s been mixed with coconut cream, passion fruit juice, and black chia seeds. Together, the sweet and tropical notes of the mango and passionfruit play perfectly off of the plush silkiness of the coconut cream and satisfying chewiness of the chia seeds. And when you combine that with the clean and simple flavors of the included whole blueberries and diced mango, you’ve got one magnificent morning on your hands.   And since all the puréeing, chopping, and mixing has been done for you already, all you need to do to enjoy our frozen Mango Blueberry Chia Bowl is to let it thaw—either overnight in the fridge, for about an hour and a half at room temperature, or by heating in the microwave for a little more than a minute. It makes an excellent (not to mention effortless) weekday breakfast option, especially when topped with something crunchy, like chopped nuts, a full-flavored granola, or our very own Organic Unsweetened Coconut Chips.

We like the story that it comes from a combination of the Mayan words pop (“sphere”), and utz (“good”). Aside from a visit to your local pupuseria, Trader Joe’s Chicken, Cheese & Green Chile Pupusas are a convenient and delicious way to satisfy all your “good-sphere” cravings!   Pupusas begin as a ball of corn-flour dough that is flattened and stuffed with meat and cheese, then rolled back up into a sphere before being gently flattened once again to form a sort of savory, stuffed pancake. Our Pupusas are filled with chicken breast & thigh meat, shredded mozzarella cheese, and roasted Hatch chiles. These simple flavors—tender savory chicken, smooth melty cheese, and mildly smoky chili-peppers—combine to create a delicious and comforting handheld snack.   We recommend you heat Trader Joe’s Chicken, Cheese & Green Chile Pupusas from frozen in a skillet with a bit of oil, cooking for 5 or so minutes per side until golden brown and heated through. Then you can dip them in your favorite TJ’s salsa, like our Hatch Valley Salsa for added Hatch flavor, or our mild Pico de Gallo. If you have the gumption and the time, you can combine TJ’s Shredded Green Cabbage with onion, jalapeńo, salt, and apple cider vinegar to make your own curtido (fermented cabbage relish), which is a very traditional, and very tasty pupusa condiment.

grilled-pitted-green-olives-074465,Grilled Pitted Green Olives," Olives truly are one of the most fascinating fruits on the planet. Depending on the variety, they can have a near endlessly wide variety of flavors, ranging from peppery to nutty, grassy to tart, and everything in between. Some varieties, like Chalkidiki olives from Greece, have a buttery, savory flavor and firm texture that some describe as “meaty.” Here’s where things get really fascinating: as it turns out, one of the best ways to bring olives with that flavor/texture combo to their fullest expression is to grill them, more or less like you would meat on a skewer. And that’s precisely what’s been done to Trader Joe’s Grilled Pitted Green Olives.   They’re made for us by a supplier in Greece, who grows their own Chalkidiki olives in groves right by their packing facilities. After curing the Olives, they pit them, then place them on a hot grill until distinct, lined sear marks develop. These sear marks not only provide a nice bit of texture to each olive, but develop a deep, warm, Maillard reaction-based savoriness, too. A fascinating preparation for an already fascinating fruit, Trader Joe’s Grilled Pitted Green Olives are superb as a standalone snack, a great option for garnishing salads, sandwiches, and savory cocktails, and a smart choice for cheese platters, antipasto plates, and charcuterie boards.

sourdough-sandwich-bread-051986,Sourdough Sandwich Bread," Toast sounds simple, and in a way, it is simple. But, when you consider that the source of good toast is really good bread, it suddenly sounds not so simple after all. After testing a wide variety of contenders, we’ve come to the unanimous decision that the very best bread for toast-making is sourdough. And because toast requires slices of bread, our conclusion also included the rationale that sliced Sourdough is the most practical Sourdough for this particular endeavor. And thus, Trader Joe’s Sourdough Sandwich Bread tops our list of “Best Breads for Toast” for this and every year.   Our Sourdough Sandwich Bread is made exclusively for us, and will be slightly different depending on where in Trader Joe’s country you pick up your loaf – the flavor of Sourdough depends largely on the “starter,” which is a living culture that lends the bread its signature sour profile. Because every starter is different, every bakery produces a slightly different flavor profile. What they all have in common is their excellence – especially when toasted. So slather on some butter, a bit of jam, or make a PB&J on Sourdough toast. You may even take that toasting to a higher level, and make a scrumptious grilled cheese... on Sourdough. Toast away. You’ll be glad you did.

A frosty mug of hoppy beer? Brought to you by yeast. A thick slice of freshly baked bread? Also brought to you by yeast. But there’s another yeast, of arguably equal importance, of which you may not be aware.   Trader Joe’s Nutritional Yeast is produced by culturing active yeast with glucose (often beet molasses or sugarcane) for several days. The yeast is deactivated with heat, fortified with B vitamins, dried and packaged. The process results in golden flakes that provide 3 grams of protein and just 10 milligrams of sodium per 1 tablespoon serving. Vegan, gluten free and Kosher (pareve), it’s ready to be used as a savory condiment or key ingredient in all manner of dishes.   Thanks to the hit of cheesy umami flavor it provides, Nutritional Yeast is as versatile as it is tasty. Sprinkle it atop roasted broccoli, baked potatoes or popcorn. Toss with fresh kale leaves & olive oil and roast to make kale chips. Use it in place of dairy or meat-based broths to add richness to soups, stews, gravies—even oatmeal! It’s also a must-have ingredient when whipping up a batch of vegan macaroni and cheese.

freeze-dried-fig-slices-073917,Freeze Dried Fig Slices," Freeze dried fruit is a little miracle of modern food technology.

The result is dry and crisp, with concentrated fruit flavors.   Trader Joe’s Freeze Dried Fig Slices come to us directly from a supplier in Turkey, the world’s leading fig-producing country. They use the Smyrna variety of fig, known for its seedy, pink flesh and pale green skin. (Fun fact: when this fig variety was initially transported to California for production, its name was changed: Calimyrna figs are the same as Smyrna figs, but grown in California rather than Turkey.) Here, that pink, seedy interior takes on a crispy texture, and delivers the expected figgy flavors with aplomb. These are great for snacking anytime, excellent in a bowl of cereal, and will liven up a cheese & charcuterie board on both the flavor and texture fronts.

As a result, the cheese ripens faster—you get a 60% butterfat, double crème Fromage that’s ready to enjoy after just two weeks of aging.   What sets this Pavé apart is its tongue-tingling triumvirate of jalapeño, cayenne, and red bell peppers. Together, they lend a fiery kick of heat and a splash of color to the cheese’s mild and buttery base. If you’re a fan of soft-ripened cheeses and all things spicy, Trader Joe’s Red Chili Pepper Fromage Pavé belongs on your list... and your cheese board. Serve alongside Sliced Prosciutto, Envy Apple slices, and Whole Grain Crispbread. It adds a splendid spiciness to sandwiches, too.

This Blend pairs crisp leaves of Organic Romaine with two members of the somewhat bitter (in flavor, not attitude) Chicory family—namely frilly, green Organic frisée (also known as curly endive) and sturdy leaves of burgundy-red, white-veined Organic radicchio. Their peppery, slightly spicy notes are pleasantly balanced by cool and crisp Romaine leaves. When combined, this Organic Blend of greens makes for a fast, fresh base for your favorite salad, and lends a thrilling counterpoint of texture when paired with rich, savory foods—think crisp bacon and a poached egg or sautéed Shawarma Chicken Thighs.

Salted Caramel Flavor (i.e., caramelized sugar, salt, etc.) sweetens the deal even more. Then, this dreamy Frozen Dessert is loaded into Mini wafer Cones that are lined with a scrumptious chocolatey coating. Each Cone is finally finished with some chocolatey chunks on top!   Eat these any time... they live in your freezer, and you can easily grab one or more whenever the craving hits. In fact, six Mini Cones equals one serving—so go ahead and Hold the Dairy, but don’t hold back!

From the sweet, sarsaparilla-y flavor of the soda to the creaminess of the vanilla ice cream, every sip summons a certain nostalgia that’s hard to top. Trader Joe’s Root Beer Float Bars take this soda-fountain classic a step further by marrying all the fun flavors of a float with the portability of an ice pop. Constructed like an orange-and-cream 50/50 bar, they’re fundamentally quite simple—rectangular, root beer-flavored ice pops, filled with vanilla ice cream and served on a stick. (See? Simple.)

vegan-italian-bolognese-ravioli-076418,Vegan Italian Bolognese Ravioli," We don’t necessarily buy into the notion that the strength of plant-based fare should be judged solely by how well it replicates the experience of eating something made with dairy or meat. However, when you happen upon a vegan version of an entrée that could genuinely be mistaken for its animal-derived counterpart, even we have to admit: that’s something special. And indeed, Trader Joe’s Italian Vegan Bolognese Ravioli are something special! Each one is filled with a rich and hearty Bolognese-style tomato sauce, with just the right ratio of mushrooms and lentils mixed in to evoke the same toothsome texture and savory, umami flavor you’d find from a meat-based Bolognese.   Like our other fresh ravioli, these Vegan Bolognese Ravioli take only a few minutes in boiling water before they’re perfectly al dente, making them an effortless entrée option for a busy weeknight dinner. While we find that they’re delicious enough with just a splash of olive oil and a sprinkling of chili flakes, they take well to pairing with red sauces, too. If you really wish to bump up the Bolognese factor, while still keeping your plate totally plant-based, you can even serve them with our very own Vegan Bolognese Style Pasta Sauce.

The only trouble, of course, is that when you’re in that something-scrumptious-yet-simple kind of mood, you usually don’t have the time or the temperament to fire up a grill. That’s why we offer our frozen Trader Joe’s Grilled Chicken Strips. Each bag contains a pound of fully-cooked white chicken meat that’s been seasoned with just a touch of savory spices, then cut into highly servable strips. And since they only take a few minutes in the microwave or on the stovetop to go from frozen to steamy, juicy, and ready-to-eat, it’s never been easier to put protein on your plate. If you regularly prep school or work lunches, you’ll especially appreciate how quick, convenient, and tasty these tender, flavorful, Grilled Chicken Strips are. They pair well with all kinds of veggies and starches, and take particularly well to customizing with your favorite sauces and seasonings—we’re partial to tossing them with a bit of Korean Gochujang Sauce, ourselves. They’re a great topper for salads, pastas, and pizzas, phenomenal as a filling for tacos and quesadillas, lovely when layered into sandwiches and wraps, and an easy addition to casseroles and baked enchiladas.

sliced-muenster-cheese-073329,Sliced Muenster Cheese," Imagine yourself, a French immigrant in 1800s Wisconsin, longing for the cheese of your homeland without the convenience of modern express shipping. So you head to the kitchen and begin making it the way you always used to, trying to imitate French Munster cheese. While that may sound like ancient history, think of it as the beginning of American Muenster, and by extension, the birth of Trader Joe’s Sliced Muenster Cheese.   Our Sliced Muenster Cheese is far from the original French Munster where it doesn’t undergo rind-washing or aging, resulting in a mellow flavor with a pleasant tang. The distinctive red-orange rind you see gets its color from annatto which happens to be the same natural vegetable dye used to give Cheddars their vibrant orange hues. Trader Joe’s Sliced Muenster Cheese marries this appearance, texture, and flavor into what is considered one of the great original American cheeses. With a semi-soft texture from the package, the versatility of our Sliced Muenster is unmatched.

Sardines, named for the Mediterranean island of Sardinia and also known as pilchards, are rich in flavor and a natural source of Omega-3’s, with one gram of Omega-3s per serving – quite a bit when you consider the small stature of a sardine. They’re also a good source of calcium.   Back in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, sardines were the most commonly consumed canned fish. When a sudden sardine shortage threatened the livelihood of one canner, he began substituting tuna in those cans, and a new industry was born. Sardines, though, returned to abundant levels and have been held in high esteem through the years. Their versatility may be one reason. You can serve them on crackers, in sandwiches, folded into pastas or atop salads – we know a good number of people who eat them with a fork, straight out of the can.

pure-grade-a-maple-syrup-004892,Pure Grade A Maple Syrup," Around 2015, the maple syrup industry initiated a shift in its labeling. Before then, there were three “grades”: A, B and C. The trouble was, while these grades simply referred to color and flavor, consumers often thought each letter had something to do with quality. To avoid confusion, a new system was created in which all maple syrups are called “Grade A,” followed by their specific color and flavor designation.   Here we have Trader Joe’s 100% Maple Syrup – Grade A Amber Color & Rich Taste (first presented in 2006 under the old labeling system). This is the second lightest (both in color and flavor) of the four Grade A syrups. Its lightness is due, in part, to having been tapped mid-season. (Syrups start out lighter and become darker as the season progresses.)

Each package contains four deliciously cheesy Omelets, which each contain eight grams of protein, making them a smart breakfast option, in addition to an easy one.

crumbled-feta-025966,Crumbled Feta," Feta is one of those cheeses that makes you think of a particular geographic region (in this case, the Mediter- ranean), yet is actually made all around the world. In much the same way Swiss cheese is made outside of Switzerland, and you can find delicious Brie made both in and out of France, great-tasting Feta is crafted by cheesemakers the world over. The cheese inside every tub of Trader Joe’s Crumbled Feta is made for us by a fourth generation Wisconsin cheesemaking family, still making cheese where their founding father founded the family creamery in the late 19th century.   The recipe for our Crumbled Feta is simple. It begins with high quality Wisconsin milk from cows that haven’t been treated with synthetic growth hormones. That milk is expertly transformed into firm, crumbly, salty, tangy Feta Cheese, crumbled into bite-sized (or smaller!) pieces, and packed in a resealable tub. The process is simple; the result is magical.   The process may be magical, but the real wonder comes when you put the Feta to use. Sprinkle it onto salads or pizzas for a tangy, creamy addition. Stuff it into sandwiches with hummus and Falafel, or melt it atop a burger.

That’s certainly the case for Trader Joe’s Shrimp Boom Bah, a sweet, spicy, and satisfyingly crispy dish that’s just as fun to eat as it is to say. (Go ahead, give it a try!)

Equally delicious as an appetizer as it is an entrée, it can be enjoyed totally on its own, either tossed in the sauce or served alongside it for dipping, as the protein in a quick rice bowl, or as the filling for super delicious lettuce wraps. And if all that weren’t enough, it’s a tremendous value, too. Because if there’s one thing that will really make us cheer, it’s getting more Boom for your buck.

strawberry-white-stilton-cheese-076724,Strawberry White Stilton Cheese," England’s highly esteemed Stilton® cheese has been made in the exact same way and in the exact same places as it has been for hundreds of years. It’s so revered, in fact, that it’s protected by the European Union with a PDO, or protected designation of origin, to ensure any cheese bearing the name lives up to its spectacular reputation—cheeses like Trader Joe’s Strawberry White Stilton® Cheese.   Produced for us in Leicestershire, in the heart of the Vale of Belvoir, to be precise, this White Stilton® is made only from locally pasteurized cow’s milk, infused with a pleasant punch of pomegranate powder and fruity, freeze-dried Strawberry pieces. It’s formed into a cylindrical shape, but is not pressed during its one-month aging period to help create an airy texture. The result is a sensationally light, slightly tangy cheese that offers pops of sweetness throughout, complement the savory nature and creamy-crumbly texture of the base.   Consider crumbling a handful of this Strawberry White Stilton® Cheese on a salad or melting a thick slice on a steak. It also presents particularly well on a cheeseboard alongside fresh strawberries (plan ahead—it’s best enjoyed after a 30-minute rest at room temperature). And since each mini-Cheese wheel (endearingly called a truckle in the cheese world) is encased in a thick, non-edible, bright red wax, it can be easily popped in a purse or packed in a picnic basket—don’t forget the cutting board and knife!

passion-fruit-rounds-075064,Passion Fruit Rounds," As a matter of principle, we are proudly, pronouncedly, and profoundly passionate about passion fruit in all its forms. Recently, one of our buyers found a form of passion fruit that took us by surprise: dried passion fruit. Never before had we tried something that so captured the experience of enjoying a jubilantly juicy passion fruit, while remaining rather un-juicy—and, we might add, un-messy. We knew right away that it was destined for our shelves, in the form of Trader Joe’s Passion Fruit Rounds.   Our supplier in Vietnam—an expert in all things dried fruit—makes each bag of our Passion Fruit Rounds by taking passion fruit seeds, along with the sweet, tart, and delighftully tropical pulp that surrounds them, and combines them with a bit of apple juice and sugar to provide some extra body. They then pour the whole mixture into disc-shaped molds, and dehydrate the whole mix it until it reaches a charmingly chewy texture. Together, the combo of sweet and sour, chewy and crunchy (courtesy of the generously-studded seeds throughout) create a harmonious balance that’s as unique as the passion fruit itself is. We recommend enjoying them as a quick, fruity snack, as a sweet treat to munch while watching a movie, or as a fun bit of cocktail decor, affixed to the rim of something sweet and tangy.

chocolate-vanilla-bean-swirl-gelato-075851,Chocolate & Vanilla Bean Swirl Gelato," In Italian, “gelato” is the word for “ice cream” in general. Most Italian ice cream, however, is made in a certain style—so when stateside treat-seekers are referring to gelato, they are typically talking about an Italian-style ice cream. An ice cream that’s intensely creamy, yet surprisingly refreshing. An ice cream that’s wondrously light, yet velvety and dense.   TJ’s Chocolate & Vanilla Bean Swirl Gelato is made for us by an Italian supplier using more milk than cream, yielding a lower butterfat content than you’d find in American-style ice cream. This gives the Gelato a light, refreshing quality while still remaining delectably smooth and creamy, and allows its Chocolate and Vanilla Bean flavors (courtesy of cocoa, semisweet chocolate, and actual vanilla bean specks) and its sweet, chocolate-sauce Swirl to really shine.   Instead of a traditional pint, we’ve very intentionally packed our Chocolate & Vanilla Bean Swirl Gelato in a 1.9-pint (900mL), clear, rectangular tub. Peel off the lid, and the Gelato’s dazzling peaks and swirls will conjure up all the beautifully decorated, sumptuous ripples you’d find in an authentic, Italian gelateria! It’s such a pretty sight that you’ll want to serve it at all your summer soirées, out in the open for all to admire.

spicy-honey-sauce-076116,Spicy Honey Sauce," When sweet and savory come together successfully, it’s always magical. If you can combine sweet and spicy, specifically, that’s an entirely different level of magic. A few years ago, we achieved such sorcery with a delicately spiced honey sauce that left us dreaming of all the different dishes over which we could drizzle it.

This new iteriation of Trader Joe’s Spicy Honey Sauce delivers a harmonious intermingling of rich, aromatic honey and a thrilling kick from chili extract, held together with a bit of vinegar. This has the transformative power to augment sweet and savory dishes alike, turning merely delicious meals into transcendent ones.   From something as simple as a baked sweet potato to something as rich as a slice of New York Cheesecake, a drizzling of Spicy Honey Sauce instantly gives anything it’s added to an extra element of complexity. Try it on sandwiches, pizza, or tacos for an elevated everyday eating experience. Give it a go over freshly baked Organic Biscuits, air-fried Breaded Chicken Tenderloin Breasts, roasted veggies, or barbecued shrimp skewers for a bit of epicurean experimentation. Add some oomph to salad dressings, BBQ glazes, and marinades with a generous squeeze. And if you’re really adventurous, you can even try it with pancakes, parfaits, or mixed into tequila- and rum-based cocktails. Magical, indeed.

You shouldn’t get caught in circular snacking with Trader Joe’s Snacky Clusters because each piece includes both salty and sweet elements.

Much of it, unfortunately, about companies trying to pass off lower grades of olive oil as extra virgin. Trader Joe’s, we’re happy to report, is not among those named. In fact, our olive oils are consistently praised for their authenticity, their quality, and their overall value compared to competitors. We know it’s not terribly humble of us to agree with these assessments, but alas, we do. Our olive oil rocks!   Among the selection, and one we’re enjoying right now, is Trader Joe’s Premium Extra Virgin Olive Oil. In the bottle is cold-pressed oil from olives grown in Italy, Spain, Argentina, and Greece. The oil is carefully blended in Italy and shipped to the United States, where it is packed exclusively for us. This particular blend creates an Extra Virgin Olive Oil that’s golden green in color, pleasantly pungent and slightly grassy, with fruity flavors and a peppery finish. It’s a terrific all-around kitchen worker—great in salad dressings, pasta dishes, marinades, and sautéing.

sweet-plantain-chips-055085,Sweet Plantain Chips," The Quindío region of Colombia is part of the so-called “coffee triangle” (Triángulo del Café), widely considered one of the best places to grow coffee beans. It is less widely considered one of the best places to grow plantains… but this doesn’t make that fact any less true! The volcanic soil, altitude, proximity to the equatorial line, and consistent climate make this region an exceptional environment for growing this banana cultivar.   Trader Joe’s Sweet Plantain Chips start with plantains grown in this very region. Bunches are harvested by hand to reduce bruising. After harvest, the plantains are allowed extra time to ripen to a sweetness of 24 brix (natural sugar content level), as opposed to only 12 brix—a more typical number for other plantain growers. The profoundly sweet, ripe plantains are also exceedingly soft at this point—almost too soft to cut. Our Colombian supplier carefully peels each plantain by hand, and hand-feeds each one into a cutting machine to further protect the fruit. The sweet plantain slices then take a quick dip in hot sunflower oil, just until perfectly crisp. When your hand reaches into the bag, you’ll pull out a handful of crunchy, gluten free “chips” with a sweetness all their own (absolutely no sugar is added). While they’re a superb standalone snack, they also synergize spectacularly with all kinds of dips, but especially ones that have a bit of sweet and savory to them, like our Pineapple Salsa.

Why, it’s new Trader Joe’s Chhurpi Puffs Dog Treats, which, according to some of our favorite dogs (okay, fine, our dogs), might just be our best Dog Treats to date! But just what is chhurpi? Glad you asked…   Chhurpi, or durkha, is an extremely hard cheese native to the Himalayas, traditionally made from Yak’s milk or buttermilk (ours is made from a blend of both). The milk gets boiled, then the curds are wrapped in a thin cloth and hung out to dry for several days. Once the cheese is quite firm, it’s sliced into strips or cubes and dried over a fire or in an oven on low heat.   At this point in the process, Chhurpi makes an excellent human snack, but to make its texture extra dog- friendly, our Nepalese supplier takes it a step further by microwaving the chhurpi nuggets. This forces the cheese to “puff ” — kind of like microwave popcorn — and turns it into crunchy, savory treats your pup will be begging for!

We add cornbread crumbles, seasoned with smoked paprika, to add even more crunch and a little bit of heat; crumbled cotija cheese delivers creamy flavor and adds a soft texture to the mix. The real magic here lies in the creamy, elote-inspired dressing that’s a little tart and a little sweet, with hints of jalapeño and lime. Tossed together, you won’t think you’re eating elote from a street vendor, but you will feel that same energy in every forkful of greens. Add your favorite protein (we like chicken or shrimp) and a sliced avocado to make this a complete meal. Grab a corn tortilla and heat it ever so slightly, then fill it with this satisfying mix—a taco to remember, for sure!

spicy-honey-sauce-076116,Spicy Honey Sauce," When sweet and savory come together successfully, it’s always magical. If you can combine sweet and spicy, specifically, that’s an entirely different level of magic. A few years ago, we achieved such sorcery with a delicately spiced honey sauce that left us dreaming of all the different dishes over which we could drizzle it. With a list so long, we decided to bump up the bottle size (by four ounces!), crank up the heat (it’ll prompt a pleasant ooh after every taste), and offer it for the very same price as the previous, smaller version! This new iteriation of Trader Joe’s Spicy Honey Sauce delivers a harmonious intermingling of rich, aromatic honey and a thrilling kick from chili extract, held together with a bit of vinegar. This has the transformative power to augment sweet and savory dishes alike, turning merely delicious meals into transcendent ones.   From something as simple as a baked sweet potato to something as rich as a slice of New York Cheesecake, a drizzling of Spicy Honey Sauce instantly gives anything it’s added to an extra element of complexity. Try it on sandwiches, pizza, or tacos for an elevated everyday eating experience. Give it a go over freshly baked Organic Biscuits, air-fried Breaded Chicken Tenderloin Breasts, roasted veggies, or barbecued shrimp skewers for a bit of epicurean experimentation. Add some oomph to salad dressings, BBQ glazes, and marinades with a generous squeeze. And if you’re really adventurous, you can even try it with pancakes, parfaits, or mixed into tequila- and rum-based cocktails. Magical, indeed.

Together, this finely tuned blend creates a profoundly Buttery profile that’s ideal for spreading over any breakfast bagel, midday muffin, or dinner roll.   As you might surmise from the fact that it’s Plant-Based, this Spread is totally free of dairy and lactose, and we should also mention that it’s gluten-free, soy-free, and kosher (pareve), too. In addition to its appetizing applications on a warm slice of toast or pile of pancakes, we’ve found its already soft consistency makes it a great tool for crafting vegan compound butters.

Much of it, unfortunately, about companies trying to pass off lower grades of olive oil as extra virgin. Trader Joe’s, we’re happy to report, is not among those named. In fact, our olive oils are consistently praised for their authenticity, their quality, and their overall value compared to competitors. We know it’s not terribly humble of us to agree with these assessments, but alas, we do. Our olive oil rocks!   Among the selection, and one we’re enjoying right now, is Trader Joe’s Premium Extra Virgin Olive Oil. In the bottle is cold-pressed oil from olives grown in Italy, Spain, Argentina, and Greece. The oil is carefully blended in Italy and shipped to the United States, where it is packed exclusively for us. This particular blend creates an Extra Virgin Olive Oil that’s golden green in color, pleasantly pungent and slightly grassy, with fruity flavors and a peppery finish.

sweet-plantain-chips-055085,Sweet Plantain Chips," The Quindío region of Colombia is part of the so-called “coffee triangle” (Triángulo del Café), widely considered one of the best places to grow coffee beans. It is less widely considered one of the best places to grow plantains… but this doesn’t make that fact any less true! The volcanic soil, altitude, proximity to the equatorial line, and consistent climate make this region an exceptional environment for growing this banana cultivar.   Trader Joe’s Sweet Plantain Chips start with plantains grown in this very region. Bunches are harvested by hand to reduce bruising. After harvest, the plantains are allowed extra time to ripen to a sweetness of 24 brix (natural sugar content level), as opposed to only 12 brix—a more typical number for other plantain growers. The profoundly sweet, ripe plantains are also exceedingly soft at this point—almost too soft to cut. Our Colombian supplier carefully peels each plantain by hand, and hand-feeds each one into a cutting machine to further protect the fruit. The sweet plantain slices then take a quick dip in hot sunflower oil, just until perfectly crisp. When your hand reaches into the bag, you’ll pull out a handful of crunchy, gluten free “chips” with a sweetness all their own (absolutely no sugar is added). While they’re a superb standalone snack, they also synergize spectacularly with all kinds of dips, but especially ones that have a bit of sweet and savory to them, like our Pineapple Salsa.

You haven’t tried it yet? Oh, boy. It’s time. This classic, Indian(ish) dish features chunks of chicken that have been roasted in an oven, or tandoor, and served in a creamy, mildly spicy, tomato-based, curry flavored sauce. A wee bit of investigation reveals that there is no standard for this iconic dish. In fact, our research found that the only thing a majority of recipes for this dish have in common is chicken. This fact rocked our culinary sensibilities, but not as much as the stories that suggest (rather convincingly) that this classic curry was created not in India, but in Great Britain. We don’t have proof, but the sources seem pretty reliable. (This explains our “ish” after “Indian.”)   Regardless of its origins, we can tell you that Trader Joe’s Chicken Tikka Masala with cumin-flavored basmati Rice is made just for us by a small, U.S.-based company that specializes in Indian-inspired foods. Rich and creamy sauce, tender chunks of white meat chicken, and nicely-flavored, cumin-infused basmati rice on the side, this frozen entrée makes a terrific lunch or dinner for one in less than five minutes in the microwave.

soft-juicy-mango-098741,Soft & Juicy Mango," Because we live in a world of contradictions, it’s sometimes easy to accept things that seem at odds to be simultaneously true. But still, it’s not uncommon for us to get the question, “How can mango be simultaneously soft, juicy, and dried?”   It’s a good question, and one that deserves an answer. So we’ll give it a go. This is Chokanan mango, grown in Thailand, where it is harvested at the peak of ripeness, then peeled and sliced into strips (it’s the same type of mango you’ll find in our Chile Spiced Mango). The drying process is unique in that it uses vegetable-based glycerin to keep the mango soft – but never mushy – and mango juice is added in to give it a little extra moisture and further intensify the mango flavor.   If you like the taste of mango, but find peeling a fresh mango a hassle, or you’re not a fan of the typically tougher texture of traditional dried mango, Trader Joe’s Soft & Juicy Mango is right on the money for you.  ","['Food', 'Snacks & Sweets', 'Nuts, Dried Fruits, Seeds']",https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/soft-juicy-mango-098741,$2.29,6 Oz,https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m21003/98741.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280,,"['MANGO', 'SUGAR', 'GLYCERIN', 'MANGO JUICE', 'SULPHUR DIOXIDE (ADDED FOR FRESHNESS).']",,"['Backpack Ready', 'Cheese Board', 'Finger Food', 'Midday Snacks']",['3 pieces(35g)'],['120']
buffalo-style-chickenless-wings-075295,Buffalo Style Chickenless Wings," Since their invention nearly sixty years ago, Buffalo wings have soared to auspicious heights within the world of appetizers—it’s difficult to imagine what modern American bar food would look like without them. In fact, they’re so beloved, that plant-based variations have been in high demand for nearly as long as their chicken- based counterparts. And while we’ve enjoyed many a Buffalo cauliflower floret over the years, they’ve always felt different than a traditional Buffalo wing—delicious, of course, but in a distinctly different category. With this in mind, we recently reached out to one of our suppliers, an expert in plant-based proteins, and gave them this challenge: a vegan, Buffalo-style appetizer that truly captures the feeling of a crisp, fresh-from-the-fryer Buffalo wing. They proudly came back with Trader Joe’s Buffalo Style Chickenless Wings.   Made with a mix of soy and pea protein, these vegan Wings have a remarkably meaty texture that’s crisp on the outside and satisfying juicy on the inside. They only take a few minutes to prep in the air fryer (or a little bit longer in the oven), and each bag comes with a packet of also-vegan, Buffalo-Style hot sauce to give each Wing that classic, cayenne kick to every bite. We recommend them as an appetizer or snack when you’ve got folks over to watch a game or movie, as a companion to our Vegan Meatless Meat Eater’s Pizza, or as the center of a spicy, Chickenless sandwich layered with shredded lettuce and pickles.

Made for us by the same supplier that makes our smashing, seasonal Pumpkin Gnocchi, both gnocchi begin with the same base ingredients—potato, wheat flour, and cornstarch. From there, this Gnocchi dough is divided into three and becomes Tri-Colored, thanks to the addition of tomato and spinach juice, natural food colorings that don’t impart any flavor. The result is a combo of red, white, and green Gnocchi in each pack—the colors on the Italian flag.   In addition to the unique chromatic characteristics of these Gnocchi, they’re also magnificently Mini-sized in comparison to most of the gnocchi you’ll find in our stores, which means they cook up in just a couple of minutes. Boil and toss in your favorite sauce, and dinner is served! Or skip the boil and simply sauté in butter until browned and cooked through.

The difference in color and flavor between the two is due to the fact that black tea leaves undergo a withering (accelerated drying) and oxidation (curing in a climate-controlled room) process, whereas green tea leaves do not. Hence, green teas, like our Trader Joe’s Unsweetened Green Tea Beverage, have a fresher, more floral, more delicately grassy flavor. And it’s exactly that flavor profile that makes our pre-brewed. ready-to-drink Unsweetend Green Tea Beverage so remarkably refreshing. Equally delicious whether its served hot or chilled, it can be customized with slices of your favorite citrus, muddled with a sprig of mint, or even incorporated into an alluringly aromatic cocktail. We find that its fine, earthy notes are particularly well suited for serving alongside savory pastries, fresh cut melon, and seafood of all kinds. For an extra special treat, try mixing it with our Fresh Squeezed Lemonade in a 1:1 ratio and enjoying with the rice bowl topped with roasted salmon.

Simmered with soy sauce, sesame oil, rice wine, and chili paste, the flavor only intensifies.

italian-bigonda-cheese-with-herbs-058088,Italian Bigonda Cheese with Herbs," The Dolomite mountain range of Italy is a renowned destination for skiers, cyclists and even stair climbers – it’s home to the Calà del Sasso, the world’s longest staircase open to the public at 4,444 steps. The Dolomite mountain range is also renowned for its cheeses, and happens to be the home of Trader Joe’s Italian Bigonda Cheese with Herbs. Our Bigonda Cheese is made for us by a master cheese-making family in the Trentino province, with over 80 years of experience under their belts. The milk used in the making of this cheese comes from cattle that graze on the breathtaking mountain pastures of the Dolomites. The clean air and lush mountain grasses help the cows produce supremely fresh milk, ideal for making this traditional style of Italian farmstead cheese, known as caciotta, that has a semi-soft texture with a creamy, firm consistency. While there are variations on the style (some cheese makers add black pepper or olive oil), our Bigonda Cheese is studded with laurel, thyme, parsley, organic chives, fennel and caraway seeds, juxtaposing fragrant Herbs with the slightly sweet, fresh milk notes of the cheese.  The beauty of Bigonda is its versatility – you can melt it into an omelet or on a grilled cheese sandwich, or try it cut into cubes atop a green salad with extra virgin olive oil, garbanzo beans and thinly sliced red onion. Liven up a cheese plate with sliced Bigonda and a foil of sweet fig jam, crunchy Marcona almonds and crisp white wine.

traditional-style-fat-free-refried-beans-093595,Traditional Style Fat Free Refried Beans," Ever wonder why refried beans are called refried beans when they’re only cooked once? We did. Turns out that the whole thing is based on a simple case of mistaken translation. You see, in colloquial Mexican Spanish, the prefix re is often used to mean “very.” So frijoles refritos should actually translate to very fried beans, not refried beans. Interesting, right?   And accurate, it turns out. To make really good refried beans, you have to cook them for hours. But with Trader Joe’s Traditional Style Fat Free Refried Beans, you can get that same great taste by simply opening a can, because all that work has already been done. Plus, you get iron, magnesium, Omega-3s and loads of lean protein – 8 grams in every serving.

Trader Joe’s Sliced Sharp Cheddar is made for us under the supervision of two Wisconsin Master Cheesemakers, using milk from local family farms. It’s a traditional Cheddar, made using the time-honored “cheddaring” process first employed in the English village of Cheddar (yes, there is such a place, in Somerset). Traditional cheddaring involves putting the cheese curds through a mill after they’ve been cut and turned. It’s a time and labor intensive process that yields a significantly more complex cheese than you get from more “modern” cheddaring methods like stirring the curds.   The flavor and texture of Cheddar changes dramatically as it ages, to our eternal delight. Our Sliced Sharp Cheddar is aged four to six months, just enough time to develop its rich, creamy, nutty flavor and almost-but- not-quite-ready-to-crumble texture. This complexity makes it an ideal mate for a burger, and it’s also excellent in cold sandwiches, panini, tuna melts, and omelets. Each slice is separated by parchment, making it easy to use and ideal for anytime at all.

Nothing is added to this mild- flavored Rice, so you can use as a blank canvas for a variety of dishes and flavors. Make a grain-free grain bowl, by adding sautéed veggies, a protein (maybe tofu or chicken) to the prepared Rice, and dress it with Green Goddess Salad Dressing.

Vastly versatile and proudly unpretentious, we’re so inspired by ketchup’s ample applicability that we couldn’t help but wonder if there was a way to take it even further.

The answer, we found, was Trader Joe’s Ketchup Flavored Sprinkle.   Made with a base of tomato powder, kosher salt, and sugar, this terrifically tomato-y Seasoning Blend brings the bright, sweet, and ever-so-slightly umami flavor of Ketchup to anything you can Sprinkle it over.

All Extra Virgin Olive Oil is categorized as “cold pressed” because no high heat (at levels that could degrade the oil) or chemicals are used to extract the juice. In addition, the juice must meet certain levels in laboratory tasting for things like levels of peroxide and acidity. Extra Virgin Olive Oil must have no more than 0.8% acidity.

More and more customers have been asking for less and less—when it comes to sugar content, and other nutritional aspects considered by some to be less than desirable. And so, we decided to create some Dark Chocolate Covered Almonds with notably less of the less desirable stuff—while still providing a really significant snacking experience. To a substantial degree, we believe we’ve succeeded!   Our supplier dry-roasts California Almonds, then pans them (tumbles them in a barrel with chocolate), and finishes them with a dusting of cocoa powder and sea salt. The chocolate-to-nut ratio ends up being about 20/80. (Typically, chocolate covered nuts are around 66/33.)

Glad you asked…   Chhurpi, or durkha, is an extremely hard cheese native to the Himalayas, traditionally made from Yak’s milk or buttermilk (ours is made from a blend of both). The milk gets boiled, then the curds are wrapped in a thin cloth and hung out to dry for several days. Once the cheese is quite firm, it’s sliced into strips or cubes and dried over a fire or in an oven on low heat.   At this point in the process, Chhurpi makes an excellent human snack, but to make its texture extra dog- friendly, our Nepalese supplier takes it a step further by microwaving the chhurpi nuggets. This forces the cheese to “puff ” — kind of like microwave popcorn — and turns it into crunchy, savory treats your pup will be begging for!

We add cornbread crumbles, seasoned with smoked paprika, to add even more crunch and a little bit of heat; crumbled cotija cheese delivers creamy flavor and adds a soft texture to the mix.

White or dark meat? Grilled, fried, or roasted? Is it an Heirloom Chicken? Wait, what the heck is that? We’re so glad you asked! Trader Joe’s All Natural, Pasture Raised, Boneless Skinless Heirloom Chicken Thighs come from a recognized breed with a genetic line that traces back multiple generations. While many other chickens are raised very quickly and given antibiotics, our Heirlooms are slow-growth, pasture-raised birds, which means they are allowed to mature at a natural rate and forage for food in a natural environment. Additionally, instead of being water- or ice-chilled, (which can lead to water retention and muted flavor) our Heirloom Chickens are air-chilled.   So, what do all these carefully complied-to practices and attributes add up to? Chicken Thighs that taste like chicken—the way chicken was always meant to taste, you might say. They’re ideal for inclusion in all kinds of recipes. Try them sprinkled with Ranch Seasoning Blend, baked, and served over orzo pasta; dredged in flour, fried to a delectable golden brown, and drizzled with Organic Spicy Honey Sauce; or roughly chopped and stir-fried with your favorite veggies, and simmered in Thai Yellow Curry Sauce.

What makes this noodle noteworthy? It starts with the Italian pasta maker sourcing high quality, organic, and local durum wheat semolina, then going the extra mile to mill the flour themselves. High quality tools are equally essential—bronze-coated shaping disks are used to produce thick, textured noodles that deliver a perfectly al dente texture, crucial to support the heftiness of your sauce while maintaining a delicate chew.   The Trofie pasta shape originates from Liguria, the northwest coastal region of Italy, famous for pesto. You could say pesto is Trofie’s soul-sauce, a match made in pasta-eating heaven. But limiting Trofie to a single sauce would be a mistake. These short, twisted noodles pair well with a variety of sauces, in both hot and cold applications.

traditional-whole-milk-ricotta-cheese-050920,Traditional Whole Milk Ricotta Cheese," “Ricotta” is an old Italian word literally meaning “recooked” which is a tell-tale, practical naming, telling you exactly how this fluffy, sweet cheese is produced. Cheesemakers simply take the whey left from whipping up batches of other types of cheese, drizzle in whole milk, an acid of some sort (in our case, acetic acid), and begin cooking the whey mixture. This causes curds to coagulate, grow, and solidify. Finally, the curds are strained of the remaining whey and you’re left with freshly made, fluffy, white Whole Milk Ricotta Cheese.   The aforementioned process is the “traditional” way (or should we say whey) of making ricotta, and as we’re never one to shy away from culinary tradition, Trader Joe’s Ricotta Cheese follows this authentic tradition to bring our shoppers a classically Italian cheese able to find its way into tons of recipes! An ideal cheese for lasagna, baked pastas, stuffed shells, and of course dessert recipes such as cannolis and cheese blintzes. In addition to all these mealtime options, our Whole Milk Ricotta Cheese is high in calcium and, for a cheese, light in fat and high in protein.

Next the Turkey is slow smoked over applewood and other hardwoods for several hours. Then it’s sliced and packaged and, voilà! Bacon. And just like pork bacon, you can cook it in a skillet, in the oven, or in the microwave.   Unlike pork bacon, our Uncured Turkey Bacon is 94% fat free!

And in our latest Spotlight Cheese, they go together so well that they’re actually quite literally inseperable! A treasured tradition of the Treviso region of Italy, Trader Joe’s Ubriaco al Cabernet is made by taking wheels of delicately sweet and creamy cheese, poking them all over with a series of holes, then aging them in a mixture of dry Cabernet wine and grape marc (the mashed grape skins that are left over during the winemaking process) for at least eight months. As the cheese ages and develops a robust flavor and firm texture, the holes in the cheese soak in the wine and mashed grape juices, turning the rind a rich, burgundy red.   This process, playfully referred to as “inebriating” the cheese (Ubriaco itself is Italian for “drunk” or “tipsy”) also infuses the entire wheel with persistently ripe, fruity, and lightly spicy Cabernet notes, giving every bite an expansive suite of flavors that’s a bit like enjoying a fine wine and fine cheese at the same time. That makes it an especially apt choice for inclusion in all kinds of charcuteries and cheese plates, especially when paired with a bottle of your favorite dry red wine.

Most commonly used in savory preparations, White Miso adds depth to soups, sauces, and dressings. You can use it in marinades for meats, fish, and tofu, or as a dip for crudité.

Made with plant- based butter and just the right amount of salt, these deliciously buttery, and decidedly vegan “Ribs” are as corny as you can get, in all the best ways.   They’re made for us by a supplier in Italy, who slices cobs of corn into quarters and then lightly cooks them until they naturally take on a slightly curved, barbecued rib-like shape. After that, they season them with salt and an olive oil and cocoa butter-based vegan butter, before flash freezing them and sending them our way.

sweet-picante-peppers-073321,Sweet Picanté Peppers," It’s not often that you find a food that sits on the intersections of sweet, peppery, tart, and creamy, all at once, but when you do, you know you’ve got something special. And that’s exactly what we have with Trader Joe’s Sweet Picanté Peppers with Creamy Cheese Filling. On their own, these crisp, perfectly pickled Picanté Peppers (try saying that three times, fast!) would be a delicious enough treat, with their balanced profile of peppery and sweet, but when you add the slightly tart notes and plush texture of the Cheese Filling inside, that’s where things get taken to the next level.   With all those intersections of flavors and textures, it should come as no surprise that these Peppers are remarkbly versatile: they can be enjoyed entirely on their own as an anytime snack, arranged on an antipasto platter or tapas spread as an appetizer, or as a topping on pizza. We also find that they’re delicious when sliced and served on a sandwich, and great when used as agarnish for salads, or if you’re particularly adventurous, plopped into a cocktail.

They’re made for us from scratch, by a supplier in Thailand, who cooks them to soft, chewy perfection, then vacuum- seals them to keep them preserved at room temperature until the very moment you need them for a soup, curry, or stir-fry.   We’re not kidding about the convenience factor on these Noodles: simply open up a packet, mix it into your dish, and you’re good to go. Without all that extra time boiling and draining dried noodles, you can afford to experiment with oodles of other ingredients, like a chow-mein inspired stir fry spiced with Chili Onion Crunch, a cold noodle bowl flavored with sesame seeds and Crunchy Peanut Butter, or a savory soup spiked with Thai Style Red Curry Sauce.

Just like its bottled predecessor, this non-alcoholic beverage is made from ingredients that include: water, sugar, ginger juice, lime and lemon juices from concentrate, and ginger extract. It has a refreshing, gingery bite, and mild carbonation. The addition of lemon and lime juices adds a zesty, citrus zing, and also helps establish the right acidic balance. After canning, our Brewed Ginger Beer is pasteurized, which gives it shelf stability.   We think our Ginger Beer makes the perfect refresher, all by itself—chilled, or over ice. But, there’s also no denying it enhances the character of spirits. Enjoy a Bermudan classic, the Dark & Stormy, made with dark rum and Ginger Beer.

That might partially explain why the members of our tasting panel were so utterly swept off their feet when they tried our Organic Apricot Preserves. Made with organic apricots and organic cane sugar, these Preserves couple the uniquely sweet and delicately tart flavor of its star stonefruit with a charmingly chunky texture that’s ideal for spreading over toast, muffins, or freshly made pancakes. Altogether, it’s a jam that’s so joyfully juicy that it might just make you see the world through apricot-colored glasses.   An able companion for all kinds of breakfast-y baked goods, Trader Joe’s Organic Apricot Preserves also serve splendidly in a savory context. We’re particularly fond of them as an accompaniment to a cheese board, especially when lightly spread over a rich, full-flavored cheese like Roquefort, or mixed with creamy Chevre.

What results is an awesomely zippy, zesty Spread with pungent Ginger flavor.   Both sweet and spicy in flavor, our Ginger Spread lends itself to both sweet and savory applications. You can spread it on your morning toast or Crumpets and swirl it into yogurt or oatmeal to wake your taste buds up in the morning. Try adding a couple tablespoons to Reduced Sodium Soy Sauce and aromatics for a lip-smacking stir-fry-style sauce.

It’s preserved in a ceramic crock and topped with a cork lid, which helps protect the crystals and keep them from drying out—it’s a terrific vessel that makes this salt tremendously giftable, and also offers countless re-use options once you’ve enjoyed the contents.   Portuguese Flor de Sal can season all the dishes on your holiday table. It is especially nice as a finishing salt, atop a steak, buttery potatoes—really, you can enjoy it just about anywhere calling for good salt.

That simple recipe: potatoes and a blend of wheat and rice flours, with cultured dextrose and lactic acid to help preserve them. Because they don’t require refrigeration, you can keep them on your pantry shelves for easy access when the Gnocchi craving strikes.   Trader Joe’s Gnocchi are soft, shelf stable, pillows of potato that require little effort to yield a tasty and comforting meal.

Trader Joe’s Sage Derby (pronounced DAR-bee, across the pond) is crafted especially for us by a small, family-owned cheesemaker in Lancashire, who hand-blends the Cheddar curds with a mix of earthy, aromatic sage and spinach (for color). Each wedge has a marvelously marbled, and—if we dare say so ourselves—charmingly festive appearance, ideal for serving on cheese plates of all kinds.   So how best to enjoy Sage Derby? Aside from simply eating it on its own or with a glass of crisp Chardonnay (which we certainly won’t dissuade you from), it also makes an excellent ingredient in cheese scones, quiches, or potatoes au gratin. For aesthetically-minded foodies, it provides some nicely verdant visuals when cubed and served alongside charcuterie or melted into mac & cheese. And if you’re ready for some exceptionally sage advice, we find its awesomely herbaceous qualities make it a perfect cheese for slicing thin and serving on a roast turkey sandwich. Mmm!

sea-salt-crystals-057364,Sea Salt Crystals," Salt is likely the single most important mineral in human culinary history—and probably human existence more broadly. The fact that we very much need it for our brains and bodies to function properly aside, salt is essential in preserving food, in killing foodborne pathogens, and in allowing the flavor receptors on our tongues to fully perceive sweet, sour, and umami tastes. Across time and countless cultures, salt has held immeasurable social, economic, and religious importance, and provided the etymological inspiration for words like sauce, sausage,  salad, salacious, and salary (among many others). All this to say: salt is pretty darn important! So it might as well be easy to work with, like it is with Trader Joe’s Sea Salt Crystals. Made with hefty-sized sea salt crystals sourced from South Africa, our Sea Salt comes in a jar with a convenient grinder already attached. Which means that all it takes to add just the right amount of salt to any kind of dish is a couple of satisfyingly crackly spins of the lid. Since it’s such a crucial part of any pantry, we’re proud to say that our Sea Salt is of dependably excellent quality, and sells for an equally excellent everyday price.

organic-bread-crumbs-092978,Organic Bread Crumbs," In the world of fiction, bread crumbs are most famously associated with the fairy tale of Hansel and Gretel.

What does this tell us about bread crumbs? If nothing else, they’re much more delicious than they are a useful geolocational tool. Trader Joe’s Organic Bread Crumbs are certainly delicious, and they’re made with organic ingredients to boot. And they’re definitely better suited for the kitchen than orienting yourself in the woods—just in case that was still on your mind.  Whether you’re in the mood for making fried fish, meatloaf, or a cheesy casserole, it’s always an excellent idea to keep a pouch of our Organic Bread Crumbs on hand. They add much-needed body and texture to crab cakes, meatballs, and salmon patties, a delightfully crispy pop of texture when used to top baked mac and cheese, and make a superlatively delicious breading for pork cutlets, chicken cordon bleu, or air-fried pickles.

Made from allowing soy milk to curdle, tofu can be packaged in a variety of softness: silken, soft, firm, and extra firm. Firm Tofu is most similar to the texture of all the raw meat and seafood we stock on our shelves, making it a popular meat alternative. Nutritionally, it has all nine essential amino acids, adding to that high profile meat alternative status Firm Tofu holds. Entirely plant-based, gluten free, high in protein while low in fat makes for a great addition to many dishes as the main protein component.

Just ask the cheesemakers behind Trader Joe’s Rutland Red Leicester. Based in the county of Leicestershire in the United Kingdom, these experts prepare each batch of Rutland Red by hand-coating the blocks of cheese in butter, then hand-wrapping them in cloth before leaving them to mature. As the cheese ages, the cloth seals in the butter, and the butter keeps the cheese moist, resulting in a super crumbly cheese that simply melts in your mouth.   From its striking red-orange hue (courtesy of annato, the same natural dye used in orange Cheddars) to its mild, caramel-y flavor, TJ’s Rutland Red Leicester possesses all the unique, delicious, and versatile characteristics you want in a special, seasonal cheese. It adds visual flair and savory sophistication to a charcuterie board, brings a delightful and somewhat spooky something extra to mashed potatoes and omelets, and pairs perfectly with a good I.P.A. or ale.

semi-sweet-chocolate-chunks-051482,Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chunks," The great baking debate: Chips vs. Chunks vs. Chopped – chocolate, that is. We like to engage in all discourse around baking, especially when it comes to chocolate, but to do so knowledgeably, we needed to create Trader Joe’s Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chunks. Made from 58.9% cocoa, a higher percentage than our chips, these chunks balance rich, dark chocolate with the perfect amount of sweetness. Unlike chips, these chunks are not formulated to hold their shape, so they melt more easily, thus covering more territory (in cookies, let’s say). And because they are irregularly shaped, you can expect some “chocolate debris” from chunks, but significantly less than if you were to chop the chocolate yourself. In summary, Trader Joe’s Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chunks promise premium chocolate flavor, are easily prepared and measured, and melt smoothly & quickly, which makes them exceptional for baking and candy making. They are also sensational for snacking. You don’t need to bake to enjoy great chocolate, after all.   Made for us by an esteemed French-Belgian chocolate company that now produces product in North America, our Chocolate Chunks are of the same caliber that high-end bakeries and notable candy manufacturers use. We think our customers deserve the best; price included.   So... which are better? Chunks, chips, or chopped? Well, the fun part is, that’s still up for debate!

organic-italian-cascatelli-pasta-072471,Organic Italian Cascatelli Pasta," It’s not every day that a new pasta shape comes along, so when one does, it’s sure to make a splash. And what’s better at making a splash than a waterfall? So named for the Italian word for “little waterfall”, Cascatelli don’t just resemble an awe-inspiring natural phenomenon, they’ve become something of a phenomenon in their own right. An international sensation since their debut in 2021, they were designed by an American food journalist intent on creating the perfect pasta shape based on three criteria: forkability (the ease with which one can pick up and hold the pasta on your fork), sauceability (their ability to retain sauce), and toothsinkability (a satisfyingly toothsome texture). Trader Joe’s Organic Cascatelli, we’re excited to tell you, passes all three tests with flying colors.   Made for us by a trusted organic pasta supplier, who worked directly with the shape’s inventor to bring it into our stores, our Organic Cascatelli exceeded our tasting panel’s lofty expectations. Their slightly curved shape and narrow, lasagna-like side ruffles give them a real edge in holding onto pestos and meaty ragus. They cook to a firm, yet yielding, texture, with a delectable, tender chewiness. And, indeed, they’re much easier to hold with a fork than their longer, thinner counterparts. Try Trader Joe’s Organic Cascatelli with plenty of Turkey Bolognese or Pesto Rosso to see just how much these three aspects make a difference.

gochujang-paste-073246,Gochujang Paste," With origins dating to at least the 1600s, and possibly earlier, gochujang isn’t so much an ingredient as it is an institution of Korean cuisine unto itself. Traditionally made from a mix of fermented soybeans, rice, barley, salt, and, of course, spicy red peppers, gochujang has a thick consistency and a delightfully complex flavor that’s a rare mix of savory, sweet, and spicy, all at once. In the case of Trader Joe’s Gochujang, we reached out to a supplier in South Korea who uses traditional fermentation techniques to achieve this uniquely delicious flavor profile, resulting in a highly versatile pepper paste that works just as well as a condiment as it does a soup base, a marinade, a dipping sauce, and so much more.   Our Gochujang’s beautifully balanced elements of sweet and heat make it an excellent choice for flavoring proteins of all kinds, from barbecued beef to pan-seared porkloin, crispy fried chicken wings to hearty tofu stew. It can spice up burgers when used as a spread, can be enjoyed with french fries either on its own or mixed with mayo, and adds a whole new dimension of flavor when added to noodle soups. And for a fun, fiery appetizer, it’s great for making kimchi-inspired quick pickles with salted smashed cucumbers.

Each one-two-bite- sized Pretzel Slim is thin, crispy, and studded with coarse crystal of salt, just like a classic pretzel. Unlike your everyday pretzel, however, their increased surface area allows them to be used as a vehicle for a wide variety of dips, cheeses, spreads — even salsas, if you so choose — meaning these Pretzel Slims aren’t just delicious, they’re postively practical.   Made from just four simple ingredients (wheat flour, sugar, salt, and barley malt syrup), we reccomend dunking your Pretzel Slims into Pub Cheese (with or without Jalapeños), Organic Buffalo Style Hummus, or even a jar of Aioli Garlic Mustard Sauce.

Both the pineapple and its juice come to us from Thailand, where pineapples are grown nearly year-round, and where they happen to produce some of the sweetest, highest quality pineapple our panel has ever tasted—and we’ve tasted quite a few. And though the ingredient list may be small, the flavors are anything but: ripe, well-rounded, and with only the faintest bit of acidity to keep things balanced, these Organic Pineapple Chunks will cover all your baking, grilling, stir-frying—or even just snacking—needs.   By packing these Chunks of Pineapple in their own juice, our supplier not only preseves their sweet, tropical flavor, but also keeps them super juicy and ready-to-eat, right out of the jar. In fact, one of our favorite uses for them is simply as a topping for yogurt, cottage cheese, or ice cream. Of course, they have plenty of savory applications, too, from pizza, to fried rice, to Thai curries, and more.

mascarpone-042747,Mascarpone," Hailing from the Lombardy region of Italy just southwest of Milan, the Mascarpone story begins. While we got plenty of positives from Italy during the Renaissance, this fresh, cream cheese offering may be one of the best thing that came out of the turn from 16th to 17th century.   Unlike many of the other cheeses you’ll find in our refrigerators, Mascarpone is a pasteurized milk and cream cheese that is coagulated from the use of an acidic substances (in this case we use citric acid, but historically lemon juice and vinegar have been used). After the curdling, the whey is removed without pressing or aging resulting in a thick crème fraîche-like cheese with a fat content upwards of 60%+.   The final product is that of a smooth, thickened cream not far from the texture of whipped butter. This light texture continues with a mildly flavored, milky flavored cheese that is so mellow in flavor it can lend itself to both sweet and savory dishes. Mascarpone is used in tons of northern Italian dishes and desserts because the original flavor goes well with anything from mustard and spices to sweet cocoa and coffee. Grab a tub today and take your culinary travels to Italy with a Mascarpone recipe!

lemon-curd-007850,Lemon Curd," If cheese is the only thing that comes to mind when you hear the term “curd,” it’s time to expand your culinary horizons. Simply put, fruit curds are a category of preserves in a class of their own, made by cooking fruit juice with eggs and butter. Typically served with scones or bread as an alternative to jam, fruit curds are woven into British teatime tradition—which is why our Buyer went straight to the source to develop Trader Joe’s Authentic Lemon Curd.   Our Lemon Curd is imported from England, where it’s been made exclusively for us for nearly 15 years. Cane sugar, whole eggs, and butter are slow-cooked in small batches with lemon juice concentrate, lemon oil, and pectin; because the characteristics of the lemon juice can vary slightly from batch to batch, this labor-intensive process is overseen by a kettle master, whose sole purpose is to stir the curd and monitor its flavor, satiny texture, and vibrant sheen until it’s just right. When the mixture cools, it transforms into a luxuriously thick, glossy, golden-yellow spread, imbued with the aroma of freshly baked lemon bars. Yum…   With flavors of rich butter and sweet sugar contrasted by bright, tangy lemon, you might refer to our Lemon Curd as “sunshine in a jar.” After all, a spoonful of the stuff has the power to brighten up breakfast, baked goods, and all sorts of sweets and treats in between. Slather it on toast or stir it into yogurt. Drizzle it on pancakes, or ice cream, or cheesecake. If you want to get fancy, whip up some heavy cream and fold it into the Lemon Curd for an almost-effortless tart or layer cake filling worthy of a royal afternoon tea.

Our Sliced Prosciutto is crafted for us by a well-known, award-winning Italian salumeri here in the U.S. They begin with full hams that are cured in the traditional Italian style, then allowed to age slowly for 10-12 months. As the hams age, their flavor intensifies and their character builds, resulting in richly-flavored Prosciutto that’s outstanding on Panini with arugula & Asiago, a natural with melon for brunch or hors d’oeuvres and super on a pizza – try it with pesto or a cream-based sauce and inch-long cuts of asparagus.

instant-boba-kit-073998,Instant Boba Kit," Since its creation in Taiwan in the 1980s, boba has become a genuinely global phenomenon—and if you’re lucky enough to live near a boba shop, you’ll know exactly why. Simultaneously sweet, refreshing, and texturally satisfying, a typical sip of a boba drink starts with the cool rush of iced, sweetened, and often fabulously flavored milk (or a comparable non-dairy beverage) and ends on a delightfully chewy note, courtesy of the tapioca pearls (A.K.A. boba) that mingle at the bottom of the cup. It’s a taste-texture combo that serves as an ideal anytime treat, especially when combined with a savory snack. And now, thanks to Trader Joe’s Instant Boba Kit, it can be enjoyed from the comforts of your very own home.   For right about the same price you’d pay for a single boba drink at a café, each Boba Kit contains four pouches of tapioca pearls flavored with rich brown sugar, which take only a minute in the microwave to heat up. From there, it’s just a matter of mixing into a glass of your preferred milk or non-dairy alternative, adding ice, and enjoying. Why, we’ve even included a wide-gauge paper straw to go along with each pouch to make sure you can capture a few boba with every sip.

Our Organic Turkey Breast is sourced from turkeys that are allowed plenty of space to roam about, and are never fed animal by-products; just a strict, vegetarian diet. And they’re also never given antibiotics, or added hormones. We could stop there... but we won’t!

It’s made from a simple mixture that includes cream, milk, sugar, egg yolks, some peppermint extract and chocolatey fudge chips. And notice that Super Premium designation?

coffee-bean-blast-ice-cream-078580,Coffee Bean Blast Ice Cream," This is why people scream for ice cream. Trader Joe’s Coffee Bean Blast Ice Cream is, in our most humble opinion, the very best coffee ice cream available anywhere on planet Earth. Or beyond, on other planets whose populations value ice cream. Lest you think we hyperbolize – which we would never, ever do – we’re about to tell you exactly what makes this ice cream so special.   First and foremost, our Coffee Bean Blast Ice Cream has very low overrun. Overrun, in ice cream speak, is the amount of air that’s whipped into the ice cream – the higher the overrun, the lower quality the ice cream. Because there is so little air in this ice cream, it is thicker, richer and creamier than lesser quality ice creams. And then there’s the flavor. Big WOW here. Some coffee ice creams have a little coffee flavor – some don’t even use actual coffee. Our Coffee Bean Blast Ice Cream features big, bold, intense coffee flavor that comes from brewed Colombian coffee and bits of very finely ground French Roast Colombian coffee beans in every bite.

A cousin of mozzarella, Provolone Cheese is a cow’s milk, semi-hard formaggi a pasta filata (Italian for “spun paste cheese”). It undergoes kneading of the fresh curd in hot water to give that famously elastic, rubbery texture that Provolone Cheese is known for. This mass of curd created from the stretching process is then aged to harden, and therefore differentiate, the Provolone from its mozzarella cousin. Like all pulled curd cheeses, a bit of Sliced Provolone Cheese is wonderful, and arguably more flavorful, when melted. This should direct your mind to the world of paninis, casseroles, baked pasta, and hoagies as a perfect pairing for our Sliced Provolone Cheese.

From decidedly savory, to hot & smoky, and everything in between, it is truly a snacker’s paradise. Joining the sweet & salty section of our celebrated snack ranks (just in time for road trip season!) is Trader Joe’s Peanut Butter Caramel Coated Popcorn.   Our supplier starts with puffy, mushroom kernel popcorn, suitably shaped for coating in a sweet syrup of tapioca and cane sugar. This Caramel Coated Popcorn is followed by a second coating, this time in the form of salted Peanut Butter, which takes the Popcorn from, “Oh, this is good,” to “OMGoodness, this is incredible!” And though the Popcorn is contending with two coatings, it somehow manages to retain a seemingly impossible airiness and oh-so satisfying crunch.

In addition to its strong, full flavors of tomato, our Paste is naturally rich with alluring notes of umami, which can be used to add a depth of flavor to all sorts of dishes — everything from braised short ribs, to pork fried rice, to shepherds pie can get a lot from adding just a little.Of course, since it is so flavorful, and since such a little bit goes such a long way, the question often arises: what should you do with any leftovers you may have, after you’ve made what you bought it for? First, we recommend scooping it out, placing it in a freezer-safe sandwich bag, then squeezing as much air out as you can before sealing and placing in the freezer. You can use the rest, bit by bit, for enhancing the flavor of practically any dish that uses ground meat (or plant-based alternatives), or for making quick, homemade ketchups, BBQ sauces, and even Bloody Mary mixes.

In other words, although we think of peanuts as nuts, they’re technically not even classified as one! It’s all a bit nutty — especially since peanuts actually have the “nut” in their name — but regardless, people go nuts for Trader Joe’s 50% Less Salt Roasted & Salted Peanuts!   After being shelled, these Peanuts are roasted in peanut oil, which is how they get their extra-crunchy, never- soggy, golden surfaces. While they’re still warm from the roasting, we add the salt — but not too much salt. After all, these are our 50% Less Salt Peanuts, for goodness’ sake! It’s all about the balance. Keep a bag of Peanuts at work as a satiating snack-at-the-ready. Add them to sweet or savory snack mixes, or even homemade granola bars.

Long before plant-based burgers and pastas, the original meat alternatives were primarily comprised of soybeans. Made from soybeans, brown rice, barley, and millet, our Organic 3 Grain Tempeh is a nutritional powerhouse full of fibrous grains and plant-based protein. Basically, we take the aforementioned ingredients, partially cook them, then inoculate the mixture with a culture that ferments the blend. This fermenting process is what both gives the tempeh its firm, cake-like appearance and its umami, meaty flavors.

They’re great for snacking anytime – we’ve discovered that kids, especially, find them not only delicious but fascinating as well. Lest you think they’re only for kids, we’ll go on record as grown-up fans of these crunchy little berries – they’re especially delightful added to cereals for a little extra flavor and crunch. Of course, given their history as a backpacking staple, they’re perfectly at home on the trail, as part of a mix or on their own.   Trader Joe’s Freeze Dried Strawberries come in a 1.2 ounce resealable bag – that may not sound like much, but it takes ten times that amount (12 ounces) of fresh, ripe strawberries from California’s coastal growing regions to produce this much freeze dried fruit. We recommend that you keep the bag tightly sealed after opening to preserve the crunch, though in the spirit of full disclosure, we’ll admit they don’t usually last long enough that this ever becomes an issue.

But making pappardelle from scratch can be a drawn-out, labor-intensive affair. That’s precisely where Trader Joe’s Organic Pappardelle Pasta Nests come in.   They’re brought to us by one of the most highly-regarded pasta makers in Italy, who doesn’t just put in the hard work of crafting each batch of Pappardelle Pasta Nests into the tender, delectable noodles that they are — they also mill their very own local, organic, durum wheat semolina to do so. They then divide them into easily-portioned, dry bundles to make at-home preparation a breeze: simply cook two to three Nests per person in boiling water for 12 to 13 minutes, then drain. From there, you’re free to toss them in your favorite sauce—we tend to prefer something creamy and savory, like our Cacio E Pepe Sauce —and save the Nests you don’t use for another dinner, another day.

The newest addition to our flavor-boosting condiment family is Trader Joe’s Organic Balsamic Vinegar of Modena. This Balsamic is made with certified organic ingredients—cooked grape must and wine vinegar that lend themselves to a sweet, viscous, and smooth Balsamic Vinegar with notes of raisin and oak, it pairs tremendously well with savory and sweet dishes alike—combine with olive oil for a simple vinaigrette for a caprese salad, or drizzle over a scoop of TJ’s French Vanilla Ice Cream for a delectable dessert.

Of course, in order to enjoy all the important aspects of a breakfast treat like this, it’s important that you actually have time to put it all together.

calrose-rice-070185,Calrose Rice," So much depends upon the length of a grain of rice. Though it may sound trivial, the textural difference just between long and medium grain rice is a whole other world, culinarily speaking. Whereas long-grained varietals like Jasmine and Basmati tend to have a drier, more individualized texture, like you’d find in a typical fried rice dish, medium-grained rice tends to be a little closer and stickier, like what you’d expect to find in risotto or paella. Trader Joe’s Calrose Rice is a classic example of the latter. Once cooked, it’s elegantly soft and fluffy, and holds onto flavors with ease — the perfect rice for poke or teriyaki bowls, and just the thing to round out our rice selection.   First developed in California in the late 1940s, Calrose Rice has since become one of the more popular rice varietals in the world, and by far the most widely grown varietal in California. After tasting it, it’s easy to see why: with its mild flavor and sticky texture, it takes on sauces and seasonings beautifully, without sacrificing any of its satisfying starchiness. Try it out with our classic Mandarin Orange Chicken and you’ll see exactly what we mean.

Made for us by an expert cheesemaker in Wisconsin, this Truffle Burrata uses the contrasts of its constituent ingredients to great effect, with each opposing aspect accentuating the other. The fresh mozzarella’s soft chewiness heightens the richness of the cream inside, which in turn is enhanced by the umami notes of the black summer truffle mixed within. It makes an excellent appetizer or side dish, especially when served with pasta or pizza, and even tastes amazing when melted directly onto of a wood-fired pizza, itself. For an even more thrilling mix of flavor and texture, try it on top of a crisp, simple salad, drizzled with just a touch of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.

Inside each 16-ounce bag, our supplier from Italy has assembled a mouthwatering medley of roasted sweet potatoes, carrots, beets, and parsnips, that not only deliver on the crisp exterior and tender interior of a slender-cut French fry, but also add their inherent earthy sweetness into every bite.   With just a few minutes in the oven or air fryer, these Root Vegetable Fries transform into an effortlessly elevated appetizer or accessory to burgers, steaks, or any number of savory entrées. They take particularly well to being modified with seasonings and spices, allowing you a large amount of leeway to experiment: try sprinkling generously with some of our Mushroom & Company, Ajika, or even some Cheesy Seasoning Blend for even more flavor.

Trader Joe’s Organic Fusilli Corti Bucati Pasta is one such majestic macaroni. What makes this noodle noteworthy? It starts with the Italian pasta maker sourcing high quality, organic, and local durum wheat semolina, then going the extra mile to mill the flour themselves. High quality tools are equally essential —bronze coated shaping disks are used to produce thick, textured noodles that deliver a perfectly al dente texture that help support the heftiness of its partnered sauce while maintaining a delicate chew.   You may be familiar with Fusilli—the spirals that have filled our shelves and stomachs for years. But these Fusilli are distinctly different. In Italian, “Corti” means short and “Bucati” translates to “with a hole”. Each bite-size noodle is corkscrew shaped, with a hollow center that makes for an immensely exciting eating experience. Pair it with a hearty Bolognese sauce and be in awe of how much sauce clings to each noodle, while never feeling weighed down.

This process creates a buttery tanginess and a slightly firm texture that crumbles with ease. Crumbly, briny Cheese made with organic milk? Be still our palates!

The humble refrigerator and some carefully chosen additional ingredients do the heavy lifting here, and the result in this case is Trader Joe’s Vanilla Overnight Oats.   This single serving package is simply rolled oats that have been basking in an almond beverage until they’ve reached their rich, pudding-like texture.

But making pappardelle from scratch can be a drawn-out, labor-intensive affair. That’s precisely where Trader Joe’s Organic Pappardelle Pasta Nests come in.   They’re brought to us by one of the most highly-regarded pasta makers in Italy, who doesn’t just put in the hard work of crafting each batch of Pappardelle Pasta Nests into the tender, delectable noodles that they are — they also mill their very own local, organic, durum wheat semolina to do so. They then divide them into easily-portioned, dry bundles to make at-home preparation a breeze: simply cook two to three Nests per person in boiling water for 12 to 13 minutes, then drain. From there, you’re free to toss them in your favorite sauce—we tend to prefer something creamy and savory, like our Cacio E Pepe Sauce —and save the Nests you don’t use for another dinner, another day.

Like the previous version, these are Just the Hemp Hearts, meaning they’ve been hulled to remove the fibrous shell. Though removing the shell does mean less fiber than one might find in other so-called “super seeds,” such as flax or chia, it also means these Seeds make it easier for your body to digest and absorb the nutrients. This is very good news, since our Organic Shelled Hemp Seeds contain plant-based protein (10 grams per 3 Tbsp. serving), and also Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids.   Seeds sans shell also allows a texture that is soft and chewy. This, combined with their fresh, nutty flavor, makes for a pleasant profile that complements a plethora of foods, including yogurt, oatmeal, salads, smoothies, dips, and more!

Upon closer examination, you find this flat, wide, spoon to have small drain holes. It’s a very old cream skimmer. Then, you realize that the message on the back is actually a recipe—step-by-step directions for making farmhouse cheese, exactly the way it was done by an anonymous dairy farmer who lived years ago in the Eastern Italian Alps.   If you were to follow that recipe (like we did!) you would end up with our Formaggio Lagorai (La-gor-EYE). This is a traditional cheese made for us in the Lagorai mountains of Trentino, Italy... from an actual recipe found on the back of a spoon. The milk comes from cows that feast on pristine Alpine grasses. Their fresh milk is shipped daily to skilled dairy artisans, who filter and chill it (to maintain it’s natural characteristics) and then process it—following the recipe, exactly as it appears on the back of that old skimmer. The curd is ripened on pinewood shelves in a cool, damp space. Once a week for two months, it is washed and turned until it has matured. The finished cheese has a delicate, semi-soft texture. It exudes the subtle aromas of herbs and mountain flowers, delivering a mild and pleasant taste.

calrose-rice-070185,Calrose Rice," So much depends upon the length of a grain of rice. Though it may sound trivial, the textural difference just between long and medium grain rice is a whole other world, culinarily speaking. Whereas long-grained varietals like Jasmine and Basmati tend to have a drier, more individualized texture, like you’d find in a typical fried rice dish, medium-grained rice tends to be a little closer and stickier, like what you’d expect to find in risotto or paella. Trader Joe’s Calrose Rice is a classic example of the latter. Once cooked, it’s elegantly soft and fluffy, and holds onto flavors with ease — the perfect rice for poke or teriyaki bowls, and just the thing to round out our rice selection.   First developed in California in the late 1940s, Calrose Rice has since become one of the more popular rice varietals in the world, and by far the most widely grown varietal in California. After tasting it, it’s easy to see why: with its mild flavor and sticky texture, it takes on sauces and seasonings beautifully, without sacrificing any of its satisfying starchiness.

truffle-burrata-072271,Truffle Burrata," One of our favorite things about truffle is just how wonderfully its savory flavors and intense aromas interact with other flavors and sensations, Take something like Burrata, for example. Already a superbly sumptuous eating experience in its own right, the silky-soft, fresh mozzarella exterior and sweet, delicately creamy interior of Burrata acts as a perfect foil to the earthy notes of black truffle, creating a uniquely delicious interplay of taste and texture — and one that you can savor in every bite of Trader Joe’s Truffle Buratta.   Made for us by an expert cheesemaker in Wisconsin, this Truffle Burrata uses the contrasts of its constituent ingredients to great effect, with each opposing aspect accentuating the other. The fresh mozzarella’s soft chewiness heightens the richness of the cream inside, which in turn is enhanced by the umami notes of the black summer truffle mixed within. It makes an excellent appetizer or side dish, especially when served with pasta or pizza, and even tastes amazing when melted directly onto of a wood-fired pizza, itself. For an even more thrilling mix of flavor and texture, try it on top of a crisp, simple salad, drizzled with just a touch of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.

Of course, cheese can be dessert, but Lemon Ricotta blurs the lines.   Made for us in Southern Italy, our Baked Lemon Ricotta Cheese starts with fresh milk, salt, and whey. The resulting curd is blended with a sweet lemon paste — made with the likes of lemon peel, lemon extract, & sugar — then placed into circular molds and baked at low temperatures. When these wheels emerge from the oven and cool, they do in fact look like dessert. And you can serve it for dessert! (If you close your eyes and took a bite, you might think you’re biting into soft, sumptuous slice of lemon cheesecake…) The winning part of this proposition, though, is that you can also serve it on a cheese platter before dinner, and no one will look askance. Or here’s a fresh idea: mix it into a hot bowl of Fusilli (p. 5) for a creamy, lemony “sauce” that will leave your dinner guests pining for seconds.

We certainly did, so we looked into it. And as it turns out, in olden times, a sugar plum more generally referred to a kind of comfit, a candy confection made of chopped nuts and dried fruit — sometimes plum, but not always — covered in a sugary coating.   If this bursts your bubble, we’ve got something bubbly to make up for it: Trader Joe’s Sugar Plum Sparkling Beverage. No, this is a not a beverage made of melted candies. We took liberties with the sugar plum concept (as many others have done in modern times), and created a drink that is literally plum-based. Our supplier combines sparkling water with an equal proportion of blended plum juice and white grape juice concentrates, resulting in an ideal seasonal swig that is lower in sugar than 100% juice would be. It’s light, crisp, and joyfully fruity, and has a delightful, light-red hue that’s festive enough to complete any holiday vision, dancing or not.   Best served chilled (with a fresh cranberry garnish or a sprig of fresh mint), Trader Joe’s Sugar Plum Sparkling Beverage makes a charmingly cheery holiday drink for children and adults alike.

And yes, it is distinctively nutty, with a full and fruity aroma, intense notes of melted butter, and a wonderfully crumbly texture that only comes with such age. A Parmesan this good isn’t just for grating over pasta (though it is excellent there). It’s entirely enjoyable on its own, maybe with a drizzle of honey, or slices of your favorite fall apples. Adding it to your holiday cheeseboard will add a wow factor that’s undeniable.
 
 It’s made in the Parma-Reggio Emilia region (official P.D.O.), with strict adherence to traditions handed down over nearly one-thousand years—from the production of the milk, through the entire cheese-making process. Just three ingredients are used: the highest quality raw cow’s milk, animal rennet, and salt.

coconut-cold-brew-coffee-concentrate-060338,Coconut Cold Brew Coffee Concentrate," When it comes to brewing, what’s the difference between hot and cold? Yes, temperature, of course, but also bite. Cold brewed coffee is never heated. As a result, the oils and acids that are released commonly with heat don’t pass through to the brew. No longer masked by the compounds that give coffee its famous bitter bite, the nuanced lush, fruity flavors of the beans becomes strikingly more perceptible. With more than 50% less acid than a hot brewed cup, cold brew is truly smooth.   While we’re pro-DIY, the actual percolation and filtration required for a proper cold brew can take some- where between 12-24 hours. Don’t know about you, but our cup of coffee can’t always wait, so we bottled it! Working with craft coffee roasters in California, we start with the same medium roast, 100% Arabica bean base as our original Cold Brew Coffee Concentrate. The beans are ground coarsely and specially filtered, then something special happens—natural coconut flavors are added to create a bold, smooth tasting, tropically-inspired brew—namely, Trader Joe’s Coconut Cold Brew Coffee Concentrate.   Mix one part Coconut Cold Brew Concentrate with two parts water or milk, and pour over ice for a lush, tropical hot weather treat. If you want to keep the coffee as concentrated as possible, you can use it to make coconut coffee ice cubes for your iced coffee. And since it’s ideal for adding coffee flavor without the acid bit- terness, it’s great for use in baking, marinating, making cocktails or served Affogato-style over ice cream.

It's hot enough to warrant a pairing with a crisp, refreshing drink, like our Sparkling Coconut Water with Yuzu or a bottle of Trader José Lager, but not so hot that it will scare off non-heat-seekers.","['Food', 'Snacks & Sweets', 'Nuts, Dried Fruits, Seeds']",https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/chile-spiced-pineapple-068138,$3.99,6 Oz,https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m21003/68138.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280,,"['DRIED PINEAPPLES', 'CHILE SEASONING BLEND (PAPRIKA [SPICE AND COLOR], CANE SUGAR, SALT, CITRIC ACID [ACIDULANT], CAYENNE PEPPER).']",MAY CONTAIN TRACES OF COCONUT.,"['Mouth On Fire', 'Desk Drawer', 'Backpack Ready']",['2 pieces(40g)'],['130 ']
chicken-sausage-breakfast-burrito-061771,Chicken Sausage Breakfast Burrito,"It's a not-exactly-demonstrable but nonetheless probably-true fact that burritos are one of the tastiest, handiest food creations. Take, for instance, our oh-so-popular Black Bean and Jack Cheese Burrito: the tortilla perfectly hugs the beans and cheese, keeping them safe until you're ready to enjoy. Now, when you use breakfast ingredients instead of beans and cheese, it's a real game-changer (or breakfast-changer).
 
 Our Trader Joe's Chicken Sausage Breakfast Burrito aptly contains all the important breakfast ingredients necessary to deem this breakfast-worthy. We went after tradition: chicken sausage flavored with sage and thyme, scrambled eggs, potatoes, sautéed onions, and white cheddar cheese live inside a chewy flour tortilla. The proportions are just right, so you'll get a little bit of everything in each bite. And, though it is a Breakfast Burrito, you don't have to restrict the time of day in which you enjoy it-it's always delicious.
 
 Maybe the best part about this Breakfast Burrito (after the Burrito itself, of course) is the endless condiment possibilities that lay before you. Do you like Organic Ketchup to accompany your breakfast? If you're from the southwest, you're probably reaching for the Salsa Autentica the second you hear ""breakfast.""

jerk-style-plantain-chips-062904,Jerk-Style Plantain Chips,"While there's a fair bit of contention as to the precise origins of jerk cooking (some argue that it was invented by the indigenous Taino and Arawak peoples of Jamaica, while others assert that escaped slaves created the cuisine after establishing their own communities on the island), one thing is indisputable: jerk seasoning is savory, spicy, and certifiably sensational.
 
 Based primarily on the flavors of allspice and hot red peppers, jerk seasoning is traditionally used on milder-flavored proteins like chicken or pork, but we find that it works equally well as a snack-enhancer. Need proof? Look no further than Trader Joe's Jerk-Style Plantain Chips.
 
 Drawing inspiration from classic Jamaican cooking, our Jerk-Style Plantain Chips pair the satisfying crunch of a plantain chip with the multitude of flavors of jerk seasoning. Each individual Chip is covered in a generous dusting of jerk cooking-inspired herbs and spices, including allspice, garlic powder, cinnamon, coriander, nutmeg, and ginger extract.
 
 What you'll likely notice above all other flavors, however, is the increasing heat of spicy red chili pepper powder.

zhoug-sauce-059192,Zhoug Sauce," Zhoug (pronounced ZOOg) likely originated in Yemen, and is now popular throughout the Middle East.

It’s a sauce that’s taking the internet by storm – from food blogs to social media feeds, Zhoug is having its moment in the digital sun. This really is the ideal time to introduce Zhoug to our stores.   Trader Joe’s Zhoug Sauce comes to us from a California vendor well-versed in the art and science of Middle Eastern foods. Here, they’ve put together a very straightforward collection of ingredients – cilantro, canola oil, jalapeño peppers, chile flakes, garlic, cardamom, sea salt, and cumin seeds – to create a sauce/dip/spread/ condiment that bursts with vibrant flavor and color. We call it “very spicy” on our label, and some will find it “very spicy.” Those more into spicy foods may find it only moderately spicy.
