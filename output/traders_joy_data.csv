apricot-mango-greek-whole-milk-yogurt-077291,Apricot Mango Greek Whole Milk Yogurt," Trader Joe’s Apricot Mango Greek Yogurt is made with Grade A Whole Milk. This might conjure images of super fatty milk in your mind, but in truth, whole milk is just ‘milk as it comes from the cow’—with none of its original milk fat removed. And that original milk fat isn’t as much as one might think. Whole milk doesn’t even contain twice as much milk fat as does 2% milk. Still, it’s enough extra fat to give Whole Milk Yogurt a creamier texture—a trait that classic Greek yogurt really showcases.   Beyond the thick, creamy mouth feel, we’ve also included bits of apricot and mango, with additional fruit juices, to give this Yogurt a tinge of tropical flavor. There are also a host of live and active cultures (added after pasteurization) meant to help bolster the presence of “good bacteria” in your gut.   Take a tub to work for an easy breakfast. Mix it with some Müesli for a heartier snack. You can enjoy it anytime.

japanese-style-fried-rice-097908,Japanese Style Fried Rice," What exactly is Trader Joe’s Japanese Style Fried Rice? It’s a big favorite among our Crew Members, and a mainstay in our freezer case. More specifically, it’s our take on takikomi gohan, a traditional Japanese style of rice flavored with soy sauce and mirin (a tangy rice wine). Our version contains shelled edamame, pieces of deep fried tofu, and thin strips of hijiki seaweed. What’s inside the package is fully cooked—you can heat it in minutes in a microwave or skillet or wok—and works brilliantly as either a side with a larger Japanese-inspired meal or as the main dish for a vegetarian feast. You could also go the fusion route and serve it topped with Sriracha and a fried egg. You’ll find it alongside the other fried rice options in our freezers.

breaded-mozzarella-cheese-sticks-050209,Breaded Mozzarella Cheese Sticks," A fan favorite of our frozen section for over a decade, now, Trader Joe’s Breaded Mozzarella Sticks may seem like a simple product, but they actually took us forever to bring in to our stores. We wanted to get it just right, and while there were plenty of options out there from the get-go, most of them weren’t very good. We wanted really good. And we got it, in the most seemingly simple way—we started with the cheese. Trader Joe’s Breaded Mozzarella Cheese Sticks begin with really good, part skim mozzarella cheese from Wisconsin.    Once we knew we had the right cheese, we set about perfecting the breading. Restaurant versions are crunchy, but most bake-at-home versions become a soggy mess very quickly. The solution to the soggy mess situation was panko bread crumbs, lightly seasoned with garlic butter flavor. This simple breading creates a crispy crust that brings a captivating crunch to every bite. We like these Breaded Mozzarella Cheese Sticks dipped in simple tomato sauces like our Organic Marinara Sauce, or simply as they are, with no sauce at all. And we really like our price, a considerable value compared to other stores’ mozzarella sticks—we think you will, too.

It’s a simple entrée, really – lean beef short ribs marinated in a Korean style sweet and savory soy-based marinade. In the marinade, soy sauce and garlic account for the Ribs savory flavors, then brown sugar is added to make it deliciously sweet. The combination is simple, yet phenomenal.   The genius is really in the preparation, and that’s where you come in. In about 15 minutes (if you count the time it takes to thaw the meat), these simple Short Ribs cook to utter perfection – just pop them on a grill – or grill pan on the stovetop – at medium-high heat, cook for a couple of minutes on each side and, you’re done.

hydrolyzed-collagen-powder-074194,Hydrolyzed Collagen Powder," Collagen is a protein found naturally in our tendons, ligaments, muscles, and cartilage—in fact, it’s the most common protein found within the bodies of most mammals. Some say collagen is beneficial to our health, and even our appearance. The human body, however, produces less and less collagen for itself as we age, so some folks turn to dietary supplements to support their joint health, skin health, and hair health. Which is precisely why we carry Trader Joe’s Hydrolyzed Collagen Powder: made with pure, unflavored, powdered beef collagen, it’s a consummately convenient way to introduce more collagen into your diet.   Our supplier prepares each batch via a hydrolysis process that leaves the proteins so fine that they easily dissolve into all kinds of hot and cold drinks. Just add two scoops of Collagen Powder (using the scoop that’s provided in each pouch, naturally) to your morning cold brew, afternoon smoothie, or evening cup of tea, then mix, and enjoy. Each serving provides 12 grams of collagen to your daily regimen, and is virtually odorless and flavorless, making it a great option for simply mixing into a glass of water. However you enjoy it, you’re sure to enjoy our value: Trader Joe’s Hydrolyzed Collagen Powder is three dollars less than the brand we previously offered on our shelves—for the same amount of product!

hot-spicy-chicken-wings-052591,Hot & Spicy Chicken Wings," It wasn’t that long ago that the wings of a chicken were regarded as parts to be discarded. But, in an unexpected turnover, the chicken wing has intercepted the top spot for beloved bar nosh and ubiquitous sports-watching snacks. Now, Trader Joe’s brings our own version of wings to the table (or bar top). Our new Hot & Spicy Chicken Wings have a list of stats that will make it hard—if not impossible—to catch a game without wanting them close-at-hand.   Here’s what makes our Wings soar above local pub grub: First, they come from vegetarian chickens. That means our California-grown birds are raised on a balanced diet of corn and soybean meal. They are never fed animal fat or animal by-products. Second, our Wings are 100% antibiotic-free (ABF). This is especially notable, since Trader Joe’s is currently the only retailer selling completely ABF, hot and spicy wings. Third, our Wings are super easy to prepare. They’ve been fully cooked and promptly frozen. This means they’re ready to heat at a moment’s notice, in the microwave or conventional oven.   Like the original Buffalo wings, ours are “sectioned” (cut in half), and covered in a spicy sauce made from vinegar, cayenne peppers, and chile pepper extract. These bite- (or three) sized snacks are the perfect finger- food. Spray canola oil on your baking tray for extra-crispy wings. And, be sure to have some cool dip at the ready. Try our Organic Ranch Dressing as the perfect foil for the spicy, vinegary sauce—with a handful of Cut & Peeled Baby Carrots on the side.

chiles-rellenos-con-queso-075234,Chiles Rellenos con Queso," A much-beloved mainstay of Mexican cuisine, the chile relleno is a masterclass of complementary flavors and textures: each bite manages to combine the gooeyness of melted cheese, the tenderness of a fire-roasted pepper, and the crispiness of its egg-battered exterior, all at once. Of course, a dish with such a delightfully complex eating experience usually results from an equally complex cooking experience, and one doesn't always have the time to fire-roast, stuff, batter, and fry a whole pepper. That's what makes Trader Joe's Chiles Rellenos Con Queso so convenient-now, having a hearty chile relleno at home is simply a matter of letting it cook in the microwave, air fryer, or conventional oven, heating the included zesty tomato sauce on the stove or microwave, combining, and enjoying.   An always-excellent entrée or appetizer, our frozen Chiles Rellenos make an especially great vegetarian option for a weeknight dinner or weekend lunch. For a quick and easy meal, try pairing them with a side of rice and beans, which will also help soak up the rich and flavorful sauce. Of course, if you're feeling extra hungry, you can always use one as the filling for a super satisfying burrito, along with some diced tomatoes, onions, and our Organic Chunky Homestyle Guacamole.

irish-cheddar-cheese-with-irish-whiskey-078395,Irish Cheddar Cheese with Irish Whiskey," Just in time to help celebrate St. Patrick’s Day, our March Spotlight Cheese showcases two specialties of Irish craftsmanship at once: sharp, savory Cheddar, and rich, aromatic whiskey. Indeed, Trader Joe’s Irish Cheddar with Irish Whiskey comes to us from a seasoned creamery in Ireland, whose expertise with spirits-infused cheeses has won them awards and accolades. Here, their Irish Cheddar is subtly flavored with authentic Irish Whiskey so that its delicately oaky and fruity notes complement, rather than overpower, the creamy texture and slight tanginess of the cheese.   Excellent for cheese boards, charcuterie plates, and party platters of all kinds (though especially for those served at St. Patrick’s Day get-togethers!), Trader Joe’s Irish Cheddar with Irish Whiskey can be enjoyed entirely on its own, or as part of a larger recipe. It’s excellent when crumbled over salads, sliced and melted over a burger or grilled cheese, mixed into a macaroni bake, or any other dish that could do with a bit of creamy complexity. And for a fun, sublimely simple pairing, try a slice or two alongside our TJ’s Special Reserve Irish Whiskey, on the rocks or as part of highball.

Thanks to their simultaneously sweet and savory flavor, charmingly chewy texture, and satisfyingly filling nature, they’ve remained a perpetual hit among the busy breakfast set ever since.   Like their predecessors, Trader Joe’s Strawberry Overnight Oats start with only the finest of gluten free rolled oats. We soak said oats in a coconut beverage (water + coconut = coconut beverage), then blend them with strawberry purée, strawberry purée concentrate, and strawberry juice concentrate, plus a dash of salt for good measure. The end result makes for a sweet, simple meal-on-the-go, a hearty-in-a-hurry afternoon snack, and a tasty way to refuel after a workout. And while these Oats are, of course, great on their own, they also take well to customization—try adding a dollop of your favorite TJ’s yogurt, some strawberry slices, and a handful of chocolate chips for extra flair.

spicy-tempura-seaweed-snack-074086,Spicy Tempura Seaweed Snack," Light, crispy, and utterly abounding with umami, roasted seaweed is perhaps as close to perfect as a snack food can get. But even that level of near-perfection can be improved upon, especially when that improvement involves a dash of spicy, savory seasoning and a crunchy tempura coat. Need proof? Look no further than Trader Joe’s Spicy Tempura Seaweed Snack! They’re made for us by a supplier in Thailand, who takes sheets of nori harvested from a seaweed farm in Korea, dips them in savory, starchy tempura batter and fries them until they’re superlatively crisp, then finishes them off with a fiery, togarashi-inspired seasoning blend. Each and every bite is crunchy, spicy, bursting with savory flavor, and, somehow, better than the last.   Trader Joe’s Spicy Tempura Seaweed Snack can be enjoyed totally on its own, as a companion to sports spectation, movie marathoning, or any other occasion that calls for something satisfyingly crunchy. It also makes a remarkably apt chip for scooping up all kinds of savory dips—although we’re particularly partial to pairing it up with other maritime flavors, like ceviche. And is if that weren’t enough, it also lends a tremendous pop of texture when crumbled over salads, soups, and rice bowls.

cowboy-caviar-salsa-050784,Cowboy Caviar Salsa," Legend has it that the Cowboy Caviar concept was originally developed around 1930 for an “all Texas” menu at a high-end department store. The head chef was mandated to include black-eyed-peas on the menu. Since she personally loathed the legumes, to make them palatable, she pickled them with onions, creating a salad-esque salsa –– “Cowboy Caviar” –– that has since become a cult classic.       Strap on your spurs, Trader Joe’s Cowboy Caviar is now in your town. Since we love cult classics, especially of the crazy, creative culinary concoction class, and we’ve had good success with our other less- than-ordinary salsas, we decided to create our very own Trader Joe’s Cowboy Caviar. Instead of black- eyed peas, however, our “caviar” of choice is black beans that are mixed together with corn, onions and red bell peppers. Pickled in a blend of chipotle peppers, adobo sauce and lime juice, this crunchy, savory salsation carries southwestern character and enough heat to take note. It’s a natural partner to tortilla chips and makes delicious fish taco topping. Gluten-free, fat-free, low in sodium and vegan, Cowboy Caviar has “cult-classic character” written all over it. Yee-haw!

They’re shorter and flatter than California almonds, with a distinctive flavor and a light, crunchy texture. We’ve taken that flavor profile a step up by adding whole dried rosemary to the mix. The nuts are roasted in expeller pressed sunflower oil, dusted with sea salt and sprinkled with whole rosemary. They’re a real treat. You can use them in recipes (just the thought of Green Beans Rosemary Marcona Amandine makes us smile), present them as an hors d’oeuvre or eat them right out of the bag. They’re excellent with a glass of crisp white wine – perhaps a Sauvignon Blanc or Côtes du Rhône. We’ve found them to be quite difficult to resist; you may want to err on the side of caution and have several bags on hand in case of emergencies. And napkins. You’ll need napkins. Trust us on this one.   Marcona Almonds tend to be expensive, but at Trader Joe’s, we have them at a great price.

irish-porter-cheddar-cheese-052529,Irish Porter Cheddar Cheese," The three-leafed shamrock, first associated with Saint Patrick, has been an Irish symbol for several centuries. Unfortunately, we weren't able to fashion pieces of Trader Joe's Irish Porter Cheddar Cheese shaped like shamrocks, but we've made up for its ordinary cheese shape with its unique, festive flavor.   The milk from our Irish Porter Cheddar comes from cows grazing in the green fields of County Limerick and County Cork in western Ireland. The Cheddar curds, once formed, are mixed with Irish porter, which was known as ""plain porter"" or simply ""plain"" in Ireland when it was first created. It's a dark beer made with a few types of malt that gives the cheese its distinct marbled appearance and a decidedly roasted, malty taste.    Clearly, this Irish Cheddar is ideal for enjoying with a St. Patrick's Day meal. Try it sliced with crusty, warm slices of an Organic French Baguette and a pint of Guinness to taste the full porter flavors.

papas-rellenas-076125,Papas Rellenas," An essential element of countless cuisines across Latin America and the Caribbean, the papa rellena might just be the ideal comfort food. While exact recipes vary, region to region, they're typically made by stuffing savory-seasoned ground beef into a ball of mashed potatoes, which is then rolled in breadcrumbs and fried until it's crispy, golden brown, and mouthwateringly delicious. On paper, it sounds a little like a spicier, appetizer version of a shepherd's pie. As Trader Joe's Papas Rellenas ably demonstrate, on the palate, it's so much more.    Drawing inspiration from the Cuban variation of this classic, comfy croquette, Trader Joe's Papas Rellenas are made with a picadillo-esque filling of ground beef, diced onions and bell peppers, along with a lively blend of herbs and seasonings like garlic, oregano, and black pepper. Each package contains four Papas Rellenas, which crisp up beautifully in either the conventional oven or the air fryer, after which they're ready to be enjoyed as an hors d'oeuvre, snack, or side, with a tart, creamy, or spicy dipping sauce. Or, if you prefer, they also make an excellent entrée-prepare a few Papas Rellenas per person, then serve on a plate with Spanish Style Rice, Organic Black Beans, and your favorite TJ's salad kit.

sliced-uncured-pepperoni-076905,Sliced Uncured Pepperoni," If you make homemade pizza using Trader Joe's Deli ingredients, such as TJ's Pizza Dough, and TJ's Pizza Sauce, you're probably also familiar with the non-TJ's pepperoni brand we've sold for many, many years. (By the way, if you don't make homemade pizza using Trader Joe's Deli ingredients, you're missing out!) Obviously, we've always liked the pepperoni we've carried, but now... you can get Trader Joe's Sliced Uncured Pepperoni in our Deli selection!   Trader Joe's Pepperoni is made with Uncured pork, which means that it has no added nitrates or nitrites, except those naturally occurring in sea salt and celery powder. This classic pepperoni is Sliced thin (but not too thin), with a savory & robust flavor profile that's been specifically crafted to be enjoyable cold or hot. This matters because we know pizza isn't the only thing on your pepperoni menu. TJ's Pepperoni tastes as good baked on a TJ's Pizza Crust, as it does in a charcuterie spread with other TJ's cold cuts, like our Uncured Salame Di Parma Mild Salami, and our Sliced Prosciutto.   So, put some pep in your pie (or on your cheeseboard) with the addition of Trader Joe's Sliced Uncured Pepperoni, and rest in the confidence that this traditional topping now has TJ's official stamp of approval, just like the other everyday TJ's pizza ingredients in our Deli section.

unscented-deodorant-075508,Unscented Deodorant," Since time immemorial, human societies have searched for ways to smell nice.

As we've learned over the millenia, not every aromatic solution has fit for everyone; some have relied on overpowering scents, or used potentially irritating materials. That's where Trader Joe's Unscented Deodorant comes in. Made with arrowroot powder and zinc ricinoleate to absorb odors, as well as coconut oil and jojoba esters to moisturize,  it's designed to keep your underarms feeling fresh all day, all without the use of artificial scents, phtalates, parabens, baking soda, or aluminum.   Easy to tote and easy to use, Trader Joe's Unscented Deodorant makes an excellent everyday deodorant: simply apply liberally under the arms prior to work, school, a workout, a hike, or travel of all kinds. Like all of Trader Joe's health and beauty products, you can rest assured that it was never tested on animals. Plus, in keeping with this Deodorant's spare-anything-that's-unnecessary ethos, we're proud to say that the paper exterior of each tube uses significantly less plastic than the average stick of deodorant out there.  ","['Everything Else', 'For the Face & Body']",https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/unscented-deodorant-075508,$4.99,1.8 Oz,,,"['COCOS NUCIFERA (COCONUT) OIL, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, MARANTA ARUNDINACEA (ARROWROOT) POWDER, OZOKERITE WAX, MAGNESIUM HYDROXIDE, ZINC RICINOLEATE, TRIETHYL CITRATE, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS (JOJOBA) ESTERS.']",,"['Desk Drawer', 'Giftable', 'Heat Wave', 'The ""X"" Factor']",[],[]

Made for us in Italy by one of our favorite pizza partners, Trader Joe's Spicy Meat Pizza starts like all good pizzas do: with high-quality dough. Our supplier leaves the dough to proof for a full 24 hours, then hand-stretches it into roughly 10-inch crusts. Each crust is then topped with an umami-rich tomato sauce (made with a bit of Balsamic vinegar to deepen its flavor), shredded mozzarella cheese, and a top-tier trio of tasty toppings: spicy smoked sausage, savory pork meatballs, and grilled red bell peppers.    The Calabrian-recipe sausage is arguably the star of the show here. It eats a bit like an Italian chorizo and really brings chili-pepper heat; the meatballs add even more umami, and the grilled bell peppers lend some sweetness to this pleasantly balanced pie. All told, TJ's Spicy Meat Pizza is the kind of simple yet elegant pie you'd find at a charming Italian pizzeria¿ except you'll find this Pizza pie in the freezers, only at your neighborhood Trader Joe's.

daffodils-big-bunch-20-stems-078957,Daffodils Big Bunch - 20 Stems," If you’re looking for a cheerful lift, nothing works much better than a bunch of bright, blooming Daffodils. Once a year, Trader Joe’s has them, ready to beautify your living space. But if you don’t know what you’re looking for, you might miss them in our stores. That’s because the unopened bunches of Daffodils look like green stems with a yellow green, pointed bulb on the end. Luckily, it doesn’t take much for them to arrive at that “bright & blooming” stage—and we have several suggestions for how you can help bring them there...   First, never leave your Daffodils in the heat. Pick them up at your neighborhood Trader Joe’s and deliver them home, as soon as possible. Second, trim the stems and place them in water immediately after arriving home. Third, place them where they will receive plenty of indirect sunlight. Fourth, as you watch and wait, trim the stems daily. And while you may be tempted to remove that brownish husk that appears around the bud, leave it in place for best results. Finally, if you have a bud or two that isn’t opening like the others after a few days, carefully massage it by gently rolling it between your thumb and forefinger.   Following these simple steps will ensure you have sunny spring Daffodils to brighten your entryway, decorate your dining table, or bring some cheer to any room in your home.

There are also times when you want a cup of coffee that’s a little more on the mellow side, with strong coffee flavor but without the intensity you get from some brews. Trader Joe’s Organic Breakfast Blend is the coffee for those occasions.   You may have noticed a new look for our Organic Breakfast Blend—rather than a canister, it now comes in a valved bag. In addition to being a more efficient form of packaging, the bag also helps protect your coffee, too: when coffee beans are roasted, they emit a small amount of CO2, and can continue to do so even after being sealed in packaging. This valve lets that CO2 escape, without letting any oxygen in, ensuring that your coffee stays fresh and that the bag doesn’t inflate. Ingenious!   Other than its new packaging, it’s still the same great coffee, still sourced for us from a series of small coffee cooperatives across Latin America, including Southern Mexico, Guatemala, and the Peruvian Andes. Organic, kosher, and fair trade certified, it’s a beautifully balanced Blend that’s been toasted to a medium roast to create a smooth, mellow, super-drinkable flavor profile. We find that makes it the ideal brew with which to start your day—which is why we call it Breakfast Blend. Try it with your favorite traditional breakfast fare, served black, or, if you’d like an even smoother sip, with a spoonful or two of our Coconut Creamer.

The 100% Arabica beans are cultivated by small family farms between the Andes mountains and the Amazon river basin. Governed by sustainable Fair Trade practices, these Bolivian farmers are able to make a living wage as they grow, harvest, and process this premier Coffee. And their Organic farming approach ensures that synthetic fertilizers & other synthetic processing chemicals are left out, which helps protect the environment, while also guarding the natural flavors imparted by this unique soil & climate.   And speaking of flavor, such admirable attributes as Fair Trade and Organic wouldn’t matter much if the coffee didn’t also taste good. In fact, Trader Joe’s Organic Bolivian Blend is a truly delicious and supremely balanced brew! The medium-dark roast presents a smooth-textured body, delicate acidity, and sweet notes that are characteristic of caramel. Yum!   To get this Coffee into our customers hands (and mugs), we’ve worked hard to secure a price that is a real value. Though the market retail for fair trade, organic beans is generally higher, by purchasing large amounts—and by switching to a more cost-efficient bag—we’ve been able to keep our price in a range that makes Trader Joe’s Fair Trade Organic Bolivian Blend what we consider to be a fair trade for our customers, too!

steamed-chicken-soup-dumplings-054988,Steamed Chicken Soup Dumplings," Soup goes in a bowl or in a cup—unless, of course, you are a fan of Xiao Long Bao. Then, your soup goes in a dumpling. Trader Joe’s Steamed Chicken Soup Dumplings are a wonder to behold, both for their display of Chinese food innovation, and for their incredibly comforting flavor profile.   This concept originates in the Jiangnan region of southeastern China, where Shanghai is situated. Xiao Long Bao are essentially soup dumplings, but instead of dumplings that go in the soup (though you can still certainly make this happen), the soup actually goes inside these dumplings. Our expert Chinese dumpling supplier forms their wheat flour dumpling dough with a specially formulated proprietary production method that seals each dumpling, allowing them to hold the maximum amount of savory broth—broth made from ingredients includ- ing chicken, onion, green onion, soy sauce, and ginger. Once the soup is wrapped in the dough and sealed (Bao means “wrapped” in Chinese), it is steamed until fully cooked (Xiao Long refers to a traditional Chinese bamboo steamer). Lastly, our dumplings are put into microwave-safe packages and frozen so we can deliver them to you.   To enjoy, you simply cut the corner of the bag and microwave for 1 to 2 minutes. Let your Dumplings sit for at least another minute before removing from microwave. The insides will be very hot, so be careful! We suggest placing a hot Soup Dumpling on a deep Chinese soup spoon and nibbling a little hole in the side to let the soup run out before enjoying soup and dumpling together.

organic-roasted-vegetable-pizza-054735,Organic Roasted Vegetable Pizza," You’ve been told to “Eat your vegetables,” as long as you can remember… and as long as you can remember, you’ve bristled at the thought. Now, our Organic Roasted Vegetable Pizza is here to help change all that!   Trader Joe's Organic Roasted Vegetable Pizza is loaded with roasted eggplant, zucchini, red onion, grilled yellow and red peppers, and garlic. By “roasted,” we don’t mean they were briefly passed over a flame to make them look charred. Our supplier near Bologna, Italy has really roasted these vegetables until they achieved their inviting look and taste. And rather than dicing them, they’ve chopped these veggies in longer strips to provide more textural interest for your tongue and the more distinguishable flavor from bite to bite. These colorful, plentiful vegetables sit atop a crisp and chewy sourdough crust (made from a long-rise dough) that is spread with a well-seasoned tomato sauce and sprinkled with a blend of mozzarella and hard aged cheese. The taste experience alone is enough to make you forget about pepperoni—at least for a few minutes.   In addition to the great flavor combination, this pizza really stands out for its Organic attribute. There are many frozen pizzas on the market that claim to be “made with some organic ingredients,” but very few that are like ours. From dough to sauce to cheese to veggies, Trader Joe's Roasted Vegetable Pizza is wholly Organic—100%.

Firm, yet remarkably flaky in texture, with a mild, delicately sweet flavor profile, it’s equally delicious whether its baked, blackened, steamed, or sautéed. In other words, it’s precisely the kind of fish you want to have on hand during the spring, when fish fries and seafood boils are just beginning to warm up. That’s why, for the season, we’re carrying Trader Joe’s Cod Fillets, a delicious, all- purpose, wild-caught whitefish option that’s excellent in everything from tangy fish tacos, to creamy seafood chowders, to classic fish and chips.   Our Cod Fillets are caught in the wild using longline fishing to help minimize bycatch, and arrive in the package boneless and skinless for ease of cooking. They can be prepared in all kinds of dishes with all levels of complexity, from the sublimely simple (baked with a bit of butter, lemon juice, and crushed Golden Rounds) to the delightfully complex (glazed in miso paste and broiled until crisp). We particularly like them breaded or beer battered, then fried to a golden brown for an unbeatable fried fish sandwich.

Over the years, we’ve received many requests from our customers for pre-seasoned salmon, to make it even easier to go from the fridge to the dinner table. That’s precisely why we’re introducing Trader Joe’s Blackened Salmon to our fresh meat and seafood section.   These boneless, skin-on fillets come prepped and ready with a mélange of savory (and slightly spicy) seasonings, including garlic, onion, smoked paprika, chipotle peppers, and demerara sugar on its surface. As it cooks in the pan, oven, broiler, or especially the air fryer, this layer of seasonings creates a flavorful and texturally satifying Blackened outer crust. A sublimely simple entrée option for everything from busy weeknight dinners to meal- prepped work lunches, and beyond, we recommend pairing Trader Joe’s Blackened Salmon with a bed of fluffy white rice, a few spears of steamed asparagus, and an oaky, buttery Chardonnay, like our very own Big Churn.

And thanks to its key ingredients – specifically, low-fat Greek yogurt – it has just 2 grams of fat & 30 calories per two-tablespoon serving. That’s 75% less fat and calories than a typical spinach dip made with sour cream. Every tub is packed with kale & spinach, with finely chopped water chestnuts, red peppers, carrots, green onions, garlic on board contributing major flavor and texture. The recipe includes with a bit of mayo for extra smoothness, and just a touch of agave nectar to add subtle sweetness.   S&KGYD is a natural choice to pair with fresh vegetable crudités or crackers and a superstar on sandwiches in place of mayo or other traditional condiments – whether it’s turkey & cheese, piled high roast beef, an abundance of roasted vegetables, or even a freshly grilled burger, the flavor and texture of this Dip really shine.

From pizza crusts, to rice, to dense, doughy pastas, this brilliant brassica boldly goes into territories normally dominated by carbs and bread, where veggies normally fear to tread. We recently found ourselves asking this question once again with the discovery of Trader Joe's Cauliflower Slims, an ingenious bread substitute made from sheets of shredded cauliflower baked together with egg, Parmesan cheese, and nutritional yeast. Take it from us: once you make a sandwich with cauliflower, you'll find yourself wondering if cauliflower's wonders ever cease, too. Perfectly sized for a number of uses - including as a vehicle for avocado toast, a tortilla or pita, or even as a kind of savory, cheesy pancake, if you're so inclined - these Cauliflower Slims provide all the structure and texture of flatbread with a fraction of the carbs (only three grams of carbs per serving of two Slims, to be precise!). And since each Slim is made with Parmesan and nutritional yeast baked right in, every bite is filled with a nice, savory cheesy flavor that complements deli meats, condiments, and sauces wonderfully.

The bite of pepper is part of what makes it so prized, and this unique pungency comes from a naturally occurring chemical in the skin called piperine. When exposed to the elements (air, heat, water), piperine can break down. Our Black Peppercorns come whole and packaged in their own Grinder, which is a benefit to maintaining freshness, along with a culinary convenience. Remove the cap, turn the jar upside down and twist to get pure, piquant flecks of black pepper. Or you can screw off the cap if you need to add some whole peppercorns to your pot. To add depth and vibrancy to flavors, grind our Black Peppercorns over eggs, steak, mashed potatoes, pasta, soup, sprouts, freshly sliced tomatoes, strawberries...you get the picture.

With Trader Joe’s Pizza Party Potato Chips, we may have just encapsulated that feeling into a crispy, crunchy, satisfyingly bite—or, we should probably say, three bites. That’s because each bag of our limited-edition Pizza Party Potato Chips contains a mix of three classic, kettle-style chips in three distinct flavors: rich and aromatic Cheese & Garlic, hearty and lightly spicy (and vegetarian, by the way) Pepperoni, and tangy, delicately sweet Pizza Sauce. When eaten together, this trio of flavors coalesces into a singular eating sensation that enthusiastically evokes the essence of a slice of pepperoni pizza. In other words, each bag is a portable Pizza Party, just waiting to happen!   An ideal accompaniment to game-day get-togethers, movie nights, or indeed any situation that calls for something fun and flavorful to munch on, Trader Joe’s Pizza Party Potato Chips turn the act of everyday snacking into a savory celebration. We recommend serving them with our fresh Buttermilk Ranch Dressing—who can resist a classic pizzeria pairing like pizza and ranch, after all?

These delicious, diminutive morsels of super crispy Mochi are like an itty-bitty version of our acclaimed Mochi Rice Nuggets [sku 56990], offering the same salty, savory flavor and satisfyingly crunchy texture, just on a tinier scale. Why the smaller stature? Simply put, Mini Mochi Rice Nuggets will have relatively more surface area per handful (or mouthful), meaning even more crunch with every bite. And that’s no small feat!   We also find that our Mini Mochi Rice Nuggets’ decreased diameter makes them particularly useful as croutons for salads, soups, and anything else that could use a little pop of texture. We like them as a topper for runny eggs and stir-fried noodles, incorporated into casseroles and zucchini boats, or even ground in a food processor and used to bread chicken or fish. And, of course, they’re always a great bar snack option, especially when served alongisde an ice cold beer, a glass of sake or soju, or even just a fun, fizzy soft drink.

dolmas-050752,Dolmas," Stemming from the Arabic word that refers to “something stuffed,” Dolmas are a traditional Mediterranean dish. While the ‘stuffing’ and ‘something’ can vary widely, rice and grape leaves are a classic, vegetarian Dolmas combination. So; that’s what we went with for Trader Joe’s Dolmas.   Trader Joe’s Dolmas are made by a Greek company in Evia, the isle shaped like a seahorse. Okay, they’re not just any Greek company; they’re the largest Dolmas (Ntolmadakia) producer in the world, with more than 50 years of experience under their vine leaves. They deliver authenticity and are adept in their stuffing of somethings. Trader Joe’s Dolmas are crafted according to an age-old, Mediterranean recipe, using tender vine leaves. By hand, the leaves are stuffed, one by one, with a soft, succulent white rice that’s mixed with chopped onions, bits of dill and mint. Dexterously rolled and folded, the leaves and rice are transformed into two-bite morsels, which are cooked to marry flavors and create a moist, tender bite. Packed in soy oil, they eat like they were freshly prepared and promise a little spice, a little savory and a little tang. Enjoy them cold, as a snack, or serve them warm with a dipping sauce – Tzatziki, lemon tahini (tahini, lemon juice & garlic - blended), or greek yogurt & fresh dill – for an iconic meze. They pair well with a dry white, like a Sauvignon Blanc.

french-vanilla-ice-cream-078576,French Vanilla Ice Cream," Trader Joe’s French Vanilla Ice Cream is a super premium vanilla ice cream that talks the talk - we don’t mean French; we mean the language of flavor! Our rich French Vanilla Ice Cream has an unmistakably creamy-custard texture that can be enjoyed plain or used as a companion for any combination of cookies, candies, and chocolates.   What makes a quart of French vanilla ice cream “French”, you ask? It has nothing to do with the vanilla bean itself (which is only grown near the equator, not near France at all); it merely means that the ice cream begins with a base that contains egg yolks, unlike regular vanilla ice cream. Trader Joe’s French Vanilla Ice Cream is made in this French tradition, which ultimately lends a pale-yellow color and a richer, smoother consistency than traditional vanilla ice cream. Notice that super premium designation? To get there, an ice cream must have less than 50% overrun, meaning that one gallon of mix would create no more than one and a half gallons of finished ice cream. Trader Joe’s French Vanilla Ice Cream has 26% overrun - aka dense, super SUPER premium ice cream!

french-roast-whole-bean-coffee-077083,French Roast Whole Bean Coffee," Those rumors brewing across the land are true: Trader Joe’s French Roast has got a brand new bag! Brought to us by a new supplier, whose increased efficiencies (including the change to a bag, rather than a canister) allow us to offer this rich, super dark-roasted whole bean coffee for a signifcantly lower retail, our new French Roast is nothing if not buzz-worthy. It’s made with a blend of 100% Arabica beans from Peru and Brazil, which, when made into drip, pour-over, or even cold brew coffee, creates a rich, robust cup with notes of cacao, baking spice, and toasted pecans.   So, what precisely makes a coffee blend with Peruvian and Brazilian beans a French Roast? The “French” actually refers to the level of roast, rather than its geographical provenance. While food historians aren’t entirely certain when and where the term originated, it’s very likely a reference to the fact that, in the 19th century, super dark-roasted coffee was all the rage in French cafés. One sip of our French Roast, and it’s easy to see why: in addition to imparting a deep, dark hue to the beans, the extra roasting time also intensifies its sweet, chocolatey aromatics, and heightens the nuttiness and spice on the palate.

The peanuts are dry roasted, made into the most delicious, Crunchy and Salted Peanut Butter.

peppermint-multi-purpose-castile-soap-076117,Peppermint Multi-Purpose Castile Soap," Some years back, we offered a particular name-brand Castile Soap in our stores. And happily so. But when the price began to climb, and we could no longer offer it at a value to our customers, we made room on our shelves for new products. We’ve brought in some great stuff since then, but still, the customer requests rolled in: “We want Castile Soap,” you said. Well, folks, it’s your lucky day—please put your soon-to-be-squeaky-clean hands together for our Castile comeback: Trader Joe’s Multi-Purpose Peppermint Castille Soap!   For those unfamiliar, Castile Soap has historically been referred to as “true soap.” The first versions were made in the Castile region of Spain from local olive oil, and by the turn of the century, “Castile” had come to refer to any vegetable oil-based soap, as opposed to the animal fat-based soaps of the era. Today, Trader Joe’s Multi-Purpose Peppermint Castile Soap is made with a gentle, nourishing blend of organic olive, coconut, hemp, and jojoba oils, plus organic peppermint oil to invigorate your senses.

thai-peanut-satay-sauce-077247,Thai Peanut Satay Sauce," Satay may be the one of most celebrated street foods in the history of global cuisine. Originating in Malaysia possibly as far back as the 1400s, love for satay has spread across Southeast Asia in the ensuing centuries, including the Philippines, Thailand, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia, where it has since been enshrined as a national dish. Now a favorite among foodies the world over, the popularity of satay skewers has brought with it a commensurate appreciation for satay sauce (also known as sambal kacang.) As our very own Trader Joe’s Thai Peanut Satay Sauce demonstrates, this sweet, savory, and lightly spicy peanut-based sauce makes the ideal accompaniment to a classic chicken satay skewer—and so much more, too.   Made for us by a supplier in Thailand, our Peanut Satay Sauce starts with a base of rich coconut milk, peanuts, and aromatic red curry paste, to which our supplier adds a mix of savory seasonings including lemongrass, shallot, garlic, galangal, and tamarind paste. In addition to making a delicious dipping sauce for grilled, skewered proteins of all kinds (we’re especially fond of it with shrimp, pork loin, or tofu), it also makes a fantastic condiment for burgers and lettuce wraps, and a superb sauce for serving over Thai Wheat Noodles. And for an effortless and flavorful salad dressing, simply add a bit of Rice Vinegar to a few spoonfuls of Satay Sauce in a bowl, mix, and enjoy.

egg-salad-057824,Egg Salad," At Trader Joe’s, one of our guiding values is that of kaizen. This philosophy of continuous, incremental improvement, popularized in mid-20th century Japan, doesn’t just apply to the way we work, it also applies to the food we sell. For example, when our Egg Salad took a brief hiatus from our refrigerators, we took the opportunity to see how we could make it even more delicious. Now returning to our refrigerators with a new look and a new recipe, Trader Joe’s Egg Salad might just be one the tastiest examples of kaizen in action you’ll ever encounter.   Each batch is made with cage-free, hard cooked eggs, which are chopped and mixed with just the right amount of mayonnaise and tangy Dijon mustard to give it a light, yet creamy, consistency. We toss in some diced celery and green onions for good measure (and some added crunch), then add the finishing touches, like sea salt, parsley, white wine vinegar, and a pinch of black pepper. While Trader Joe’s Egg Salad is certainly delightful on its own, it truly sings as part of an egg salad sandwich. We suggest using toasted slices of French Brioche and adding soft, luscious leaves of Little Gem Lettuce—or you can skip the bread and make egg salad lettuce wraps instead! And if you’d rather not commit to a whole meal, make yourself a snack by spooning this Salad onto some freshly toasted baguette slices and sprinkled with Smoked Paprika.

Each box of Trader Joe’s Snickerdoodle Cookies contains a dozen perfectly baked, scrumptiously cinammon-y Snickerdoodles, ready to be enjoyed whenever the Snickerdoodle mood strikes. (Please pardon the repetition; it really is just that fun to say.) Made from a traditional, homestyle recipe that includes cream of tartar for an extra crisp texture and korintje cinnamon for an even brighter touch of cinnamon spice in every bite, they make a great school or work lunch dessert, as well as a simple, anytime sweet treat.

beer-bread-mix-093094,Beer Bread Mix," ""Just add beer and butter""-possibly the five best words to be combined in one sentence. It's also the phrase you'll find gracing each box of Trader Joe's Beer Bread Mix. Preparation is simple enough: Stir 12 ounces of the beer of your choosing into the Mix, and add the dough to a greased loaf pan. Pour some melted butter over the top, pop it into the oven, and your work is done! No matter what kind of beer you use (a lager for a lighter loaf, an IPA for a hearty, hoppy taste, or a stout for a rich result with a slightly darker finished product), you'll end up with malty, buttery bread with a golden crust and tender crumb. And while we're fans of baking, we're also fans of enjoying fresh bread after a long day at work-this Mix provides that fresh-baked, belly-warming goodness, without the spend-all-weekend-making-it level of effort that usually accompanies such bread baking projects. Aside from its malty, buttery dreamy-ness and incredible convenience, the beauty of Trader Joe's Beer Bread Mix is you can customize it to your liking. Experiment with different beers, or add a handful of shredded Unexpected Cheddar and a scoop of Hot & Sweet Jalapeños to the dough. Serve the finished loaf with a bowl of your favorite chili or soup for supper-without a doubt, it's the craveable comfort food required in the face of blustery winter weather.

That’s why we recommend getting them in your day-to-day hydrating, in the form of Trader Joe’s Organic Cold Pressed Green Juice Beverage – a delicious and refreshing blend of leafy greens, veggies, and zesty citrus fruit.   As brilliantly green as it is brilliantly concocted, each serving (about eight fl. ounces) of this Green Juice Beverage contains the following: one cucumber, two stalks of celery, a quarter of a grapefruit, a quarter of a head of lettuce, one kale leaf, four spinach leaves, six sprigs of parsley, a teaspoon of mint tea, and a bit of lemon. In other words, there’s close an entire garden’s worth of veggies, cold pressed and ready to drink, inside each bottle – and an organic garden, at that! Each sip delivers not just a boost of revitalizing and nutrient- rich veggies, but a lively mélange of flavors, too: cool notes of cucumber, a bright and bracing hint of celery, refreshing citrus, and an invigorating taste of mint, right on the finish.

After that, it’s just a matter of giving them a quick pan-sear with butter and lemon juice, a few minutes under the broiler with garlic and olive oil, or just enough time on the grill, threaded through skewers, until opaque on both sides.

kohlrabi-vegetable-pasta-073035,Kohlrabi Vegetable Pasta," Though it’s widely known as the “German turnip,” kohlrabi is less like that root vegetable, and more like its cousin cabbage, as “Kohl” (aka Cole) implies. This cruciferous vegetable can be eaten raw or cooked, but with Trader Joe’s Kohlrabi Vegetable Pasta, we have something even more specific in mind...   We’ve taken Kohlrabi, peeled off the outer layer, and spiralized it, cutting it into long flat strips of varied lengths. This gives it that “Pasta” profile, even though it is 100% vegetable, with nothing else added. To enjoy, you can simply sauté the “noodles” in a pan with a little bit of olive oil until hot. Even simpler, you can actually just microwave the entire bag, intact, for 4-5 minutes, steaming the Kohlrabi.   The white to light-green colored, gluten free Vegetable Pasta has a fresh aroma and mild, slightly peppery flavor that partners well with all kinds of sauces. Try it with Cacio E Pepe Pasta Sauce, or keep things vegan by tossing this Kohlrabi with our Vegan Bolognese Style Pasta Sauce.

These limited-edition Sweet Rolled Danish Pastries are made in Denmark, where our supplier hand-forms the eggy dough into elegant knots, and incorporates plenty of Cardamom and Brown Sugar in the process. Once baked, the resulting pastry isn’t overly sweet, allowing the heady spice notes to take center stage in each tender bite. Cozy up with a Bun and a cup of rich, dark roast coffee as an antidote to chilly winter weather— they can be enjoyed right out of the package, or heated for a few minutes in the oven. Perhaps best of all, you can find packages of two, generously-sized Brown Sugar Cardamom Buns on the bakery shelves at your neighborhood Trader Joe’s, for less than the price of one similar pastry elsewhere—if one can even be found!

So, you can imagine how delighted we were at a recent tasting panel, when our product developer presented yet another way to enjoy peanut butter: Trader Joe’s Peanut Butter Flavored Baking Chips!   Creamy and nutty, sweet and salty, Trader Joe’s Peanut Butter Flavored Baking Chips truly are a baker’s best friend. While other peanut butter chips on the market rely on artificial flavors, these Baking Chips get their Peanut flavor from peanuts (or more specifically, peanut flour). These kosher (dairy)-certified Chips can of course be used for Baking (cookies, brownies, pancakes, muffins, etc.), but feel free to let the chips fall where they may: into a trek mix, atop a bowl of ice cream, or even right into your mouth.

bourbon-vanilla-bean-paste-076862,Bourbon Vanilla Bean Paste," If you’ve ever spent any time baking, you’ve likely dealt with vanilla extract before (it’s basically the duct tape of the baking world). What you might not have encountered, however, is vanilla paste. What’s the difference, you ask? Aside from their distinct methods of production (vanilla extract is made by soaking pure vanilla beans in a solution of water and alcohol, whereas vanilla paste is a mix of vanilla beans, sugar syrup, and some vanilla extract to tie them all together), vanilla paste is thicker, richer in taste, and tends to have more visible bits of vanilla bean throughout, making it a preferable option for recipes where you really want the vanilla to be front and center. And that’s exactly where Trader Joe’s Bourbon Vanilla Bean Paste excels.   Made for us by a supplier in Mauritius with 100% Bourbon (as in, grown in one of the designated Bourbon islands within the Indian Ocean) Vanilla Beans, this Vanilla Paste adds a well-rounded sweetness and deep, full-bodied flavor of vanilla to cakes, cookies, pies, and more. It can be used in a straight 1:1 ratio as a substitute for vanilla extract, for any recipe you’d like to make that much more vanilla-y, and makes an excellent ingredient for cocktails, milkshakes, and homemade coffee drinks.

Our Baingan Bharta makes an excellent (and effortless) lunch or dinner option when enjoyed entirely on its own, and an even better entrée when served over Basmati Rice as part of a larger meal. Speaking of which, we find that it’s especially suited for pairing with a nice Naan or other warm flatbread, for scooping.

As one of our darkest, richest roasts, it’s excellent for making everything from espresso, to pour-over, to French press.   Long-time Five Country fans may recall the previous canister of Five Country Espresso Blend offered on shelves—it had an admittedly limiting moniker, as “Espresso” referenced a single coffee preparation instead of the numerous ways a dark roast coffee can be ground, brewed and enjoyed. Our new Five Country Blend maintains the beloved flavor profile and bean origins of its predecessor, is still Organic and kosher (pareve)-certified, and holds Fairtrade certification, guaranteeing small-scale growers are given a fair price for their harvest.

Since the 1500s, Calabrian hot chili peppers have been a staple of Southern Italian cuisine, especially when crushed, fermented, and mixed into a firey hot condiment, just like this Bomba Sauce.

As Trader Joe’s Chicken Meatballs demonstrate (to a decidedly delicious degree, we might add) a good meatball delivers tender texture, deeply savory flavor, and affords the opportunity for all kinds of rich, aromatic seasonings. True to form, Trader Joe’s Chicken Meatballs can be enjoyed in all kinds of culinary situations, be it in a stir-fry, sandwich, or soup, or even simply enjoyed on their own, accompanied by your favorite dipping sauce, as a quick and easy appetizer.   They’re made especially for us by a supplier who uses all natural, ground chicken breast and thigh meat, seasons it with oregano, basil, and black pepper, and hand-crafts it into ideal, one-or-two-bite sized Meatballs before fully cooking them. That means, once they reach your home, all you need to worry about is reheating them, which can be done on your stovetop, or in the microwave, oven, or air fryer in a matter of minutes.

Noticing the trend—and admiring the benefits of this gluten-free pseudo-grain—Trader Joe’s began developing products that feature quinoa, including our Organic Brown Rice & Quinoa Fusilli Pasta. Having been around for about a decade now, this Fusilli is still a hit with our customers, even for those who are not seeking a gluten-free option.   But what sets this Pasta apart from other gluten free noodles? Notably, our Organic Fusilli is made of 20% Quinoa. When we created it, similar gluten-free pastas only contained about 5% quinoa. We combined the Organic Quinoa with Organic Brown Rice, yielding a pasta product that is texturally tantalizing, and nutritionally interesting. Not only is it gluten, sodium, and sugar free, but each two-thirds cup serving delivers 4g of protein and 2g of fiber.   And the subtly nutty flavor pairs well with a variety of sauces and preparations. Enjoy it served hot, tossed with pasta sauce and grated Parmesan.

Since the 1980s, some version of these crisp, fried, gram-flour flatbreads has been paired with sweet mango chutneys and mint sauce in nearly every UK curry house—not to mention other Indian-style restaurants all around the world.   Trader Joe’s Papadums are perhaps smaller than the large crisps you may have seen presented in a basket at your local Indian restaurant. But other than being one or two-bite sized, these Papadums are made in a traditional fashion. Our supplier starts with simple ingredients, making a dough derived from lentils and chickpeas. Formed into thin, chip-like discs, the dough is then fried in rice bran oil, and lightly seasoned with salt and cumin, as is common practice in parts of northern India.   The resulting airy Crisps have a lightly nutty taste and a wonderful crunch. And they’re an ideal size for carrying your favorite Trader Joe’s dip right into your open mouth.

Well, not a punch, per se, but a pleasant tartness that goes swing-for-swing with the sweetness. Sweet, meet sour. Sour, meet sweet.    Just how does our glorious Green Mango get its tangy twist? It’s pretty simple, actually. Our Thai supplier picks their mangoes early, before they’re ripe.

Like tofu, yuba is incredibly mild and takes on the flavor of whatever it’s cooked with, making Trader Joe’s Tofu Sheets the perfect protein to add to everything from curries and stir-fries to soups and stews.   Made for us in Malaysia, Trader Joe’s Tofu Sheets are the very same sheets used in our perennially popular Vegan Thai Green Curry. The Sheets come conveniently frozen; simply cut the corner of the pouch they come in, then heat it in the microwave for 21⁄2 minutes, and you’re ready to rock ‘n roll.

tortilla-espanola-075756,Tortilla Española," In contrast to the corn and flour tortillas of Mesoamerican and Mexican cuisine, a Spanish tortilla (also known as a Spanish omelette) is more akin to a hearty frittata. Typically made from a mix of eggs, potatoes, and, often, thinly sliced onions, the tortilla is a cornerstone of the Spanish culinary tradition of tapas, where it’s served alongside other appetizers and finger foods. Surprisingly complex in both flavor and texture for its seemingly simple ingredient list, a Spanish tortilla can also be surprisingly difficult to make at home, which makes the ease of preparing Trader Joe’s Tortilla Española all the more impressive.   Made for us by a supplier in Spain who specializes in this iconic dish, our Tortilla Española only needs a few minutes on the stovetop (or a little longer in the microwave) to go from frozen to ready to serve. Rich, yet texturally light, with a well-balanced blend of savory flavors, Trader Joe’s Tortilla Española is particularly suited for pairing with drinks when friends are over, or as an appetizer for an elegant dinner party. It’s equally delicious when served warm, at room temperature, or even cold (as a leftover, straight out of the fridge, perhaps), and we find it makes an excellent quick breakfast option, too—especially if you top it with a bit of your favorite hot sauce.

rice-vinegar-076721,Rice Vinegar," A true building block of many East Asian cuisines, the origins of rice vinegar date somewhere between four and five thousand years ago to ancient China. It’s traditionally made by fermenting rice wine, and over its long and storied history has been used as everything from a flavoring agent, to a preservative, to beverage in its own right. It comes in a variety of colors ranging from red, to white, to brown and black, and is sometimes seasoned with sugar or other flavorings. Trader Joe’s Rice Vinegar is styled after an everyday, unseasoned, white rice vinegar, but it’s certainly not lacking for flavor. Tart, tangy, and just a touch sweet, with a slightly sharp note for cutting through and brightening other flavors, it’s an ideal ingredient for adding to salad dressings, sauces, and marinades of all kinds. A bit of our Rice Vinegar will add an extra dimension of flavor to stir-fries, soups, and even just a freshly cooked pot of plain white rice. When mixed with soy sauce, it makes an excellent condiment for any of our gyoza or soup dumpling options, though we’ll leave the exact ratio to your personal tastes (some prefer equal parts soy sauce to Rice Vinegar, others enjoy two parts Vinegar to one part soy sauce). And when making quick pickles or a last-minute seaweed salad, our Rice Vinegar is nothing short of a must-have.

Then, to bring everything together, they mix in a spicy, umami-rich peanut sauce. With every bite, you get exhilarating aromas of ginger and Sczechuan pepper, rich and complex flavors of tamari and peanuts, complementary textures of the noodles and minced chicken, and, of course, a touch of chile-powered heat.

It’s wild-caught in the icy waters of the major Northeast Pacific fishing area located west of Canada and south of Alaska. Our supplier dry cures the Wild Sockeye then smokes it very slowly over applewood (from Washington state apple trees) at a relatively low temperature (below 85°F) to yield firm-textured fish with rich salmon flavor, and hints of smoke & salt.

Cream cheese is a simple, yet classic culinary staple finding its way into many recipes, whether they may be for savory dinners or delightful desserts. Our suppliers begin with premium pasteurized milk and cream and use cheese cultures during a heating process to create a luscious creamed cheese. But where our Whipped Cream Cheese strays the traditional path is with the final step of whipping air into the cream cheese mixture and adding more milk for a lighter, fluffier texture. This makes it perfect for when you just need a spreadable addition to your brunch-time bagel or to make, say, a less dense cream cheese frosting for a summer-friendly carrot or banana cake.

cream-cheese-012491,Cream Cheese," A brick, or a block: what’s the difference? It seems like a negligible distinction, but we take such distinctions seriously—especially when it comes to Trader Joe’s Cream Cheese.   Within the cheese biz, this particular presentation of Cream Cheese is known as a “brick.” Brick, however, sounds heavy, and this creamy creation is anything but. Made for us using fresh milk and cream from cows not treated with rBST, it’s everything you want cream cheese to be—rich, creamy, and when softened, quite spread- able. So, rather than “brick,” we’d like to refer to our Cream Cheese as a “block,” as in “building block,” since it can be a building block in so many delicious dishes.   What’s that? You want examples? Sure. A simple appetizer idea: set it on a plate, top with salsa or sweet chili sauce and serve with tortilla chips or crackers for a Mexican or Thai inspired dip. How’s that for instant versa- tility? And speaking of dips, cream cheese is the star of any number of creamy dips. Don’t forget bagels—but how could you forget bagels? Perhaps our favorite usage for this particular building block is cheesecake. If you’re up to the challenge of making a cheesecake from scratch, you won’t find a better foundation.

petit-fours-mousse-cakes-076604,Petit Fours Mousse Cakes," In the 18th century, baking was a slightly more involved process than it is today. Back then, French bakers relied on ovens that took quite a long time to heat up, and even longer to cool down. So, after they were done making their breads for the day à grand fours (“at large oven,” i.e., at full heat), they would take the opportunity to use their oven’s residual heat to bake small, delicate pastries à petit fours (“at small oven,” i.e., at diminishing heat). Though ovens have changed over the years, the fandom for petit fours cakes has only grown. We’re certainly fans, which is precisely why we’re introducing Trader Joe’s Petit Fours Mousse Cakes to our bakery tables for the holidays.   Each package contains nine elegantly decorated, two-or-three-bite-sized Petit Fours Cakes in three distinct styles: three rich chocolate Cakes layered with silky chocolate Mousse, covered in a dark chocolatey coating; three vanilla Cakes layered with velvety vanilla Mousse, covered in a sweet vanilla coating and topped with pearl sugar; and three chocolate Cakes layered with smooth coffee Mousse, covered in a mocha coating and topped with bits of dark chocolate and sugar. Ideal for serving at holiday parties and get-togethers of all kinds, these light, sweet, and texturally refined Petit Fours Mousse Cakes make a great inclusion for a dessert table, a lovely host or hostess gift when visiting friends or family, and a delightfully decorative addition to an after- dinner pie or cake plate after a holiday feast.

It’s a difference you can taste in every cup of Cachoeira da Grama: each sip starts with aromas of citrus leaves and ripe fruit, which leads into balanced flavors of dried plum and orange zest, and eventually into a long, lazy finish. An excellent candidate for preparing via French press or enjoyed as pour over, Cachoeira da Grama mixes marvelously well with milk or your favorite non-dairy creamer, and pairs especially well with breakfast pastries, brunch fare, and toffee-like candies, like our Pecan Pralines.

Blessed with a mild, subtropical climate, and dizzying 4,000- foot elevation, Darjeeling has some of the best conditions on the planet for growing tea leaves, producing blends marked with an elegantly delicate sweetness and herby, refreshing aroma. In fact, Darjeeling is often called “the Champagne of teas,” which is certainly an apt comparison point for our fine, bright, and lightly fruity Trader Joe’s Organic Darjeeling Green Tea. (Except for the bubbles, of course.)   Naturally sweet and rich in antioxidants, our Organic Darjeeling Green Tea serves just as well as a special occasion kind of tea, with cucumber sandwiches and Macarons, as it does your everyday cuppa. We’re particularly fond of enjoying it as a morning or afternoon pickmeup, especially when paired with pastries, fruits, or mild and tangy fare: think fresh cut melon, a slice of French Apple Tart, or slices of apple spread with a bit of Fine Herbs Chevre.

apple-tatin-tartelettes-075252,Apple Tatin Tartelettes," Like so many of the world’s tastiest creations, the first tarte Tatin came about quite by accident. As the story goes, in setting out to make a traditional apple pie, an overworked French hotelier (a one Ms. Stéphanie Tatin, co-owner of the Hôtel Tatin) left her apples cooking in butter and sugar for far too long. To salvage her extra- caramelized endeavor, she placed a layer of pastry over the apples, popped the whole pan in the oven, and served the resulting dessert upside-down. Her guests loved this accidental apple pie-alternative so much that it became a fixture on the menu and, ultimately, rose to prominence all over France.   Accident or no accident, however, making a modern-day Apple Tatin from scratch is actually quite a tricky and time-consuming endeavor. Lucky for you, for a limited time, we’re doing the work for you—and we’re doing it well—with Trader Joe’s Apple Tatin Tartelettes! They’re made for us authentically in France, and they heat from frozen in just 15-20 minutes in the oven or 11⁄2-2 minutes in the microwave. They come two- to-a-box, so you can enjoy them one Tartelette at a time, or, if you’re feeling generous, you can share your Tartelettes with the apple of your eye!

Whether it’s an everyday gem or one of our limited-quantity Trader Joe’s Reserve wines, there’s always something reliably fantastic to try—and for an unimpeachably excellent value, too. Now, we’re continuing that mission with the introduction of Trading Post by Trader Joe’s. Made exclusively for us by a trusted winery partner in the heart of Napa Valley, you can think of the Trading Post label as the best of both worlds among our wine selection, combining the same outstanding quality and value of our limited-run Reserve wines with the consistent availability of our everyday favorites.   For the Trading Post’s inaugural outing, we’re offering a characteristically robust and elegant Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon. With rich and alluring aromatics of black cherry, vanilla, and tobacco, and a complex profile of ripe fruit, baking spice, and toasty oak, it’s precisely the kind of jammy Cab that made Napa famous. Bold, yet easy-drinking, with a long, languid, satisfying finish, it serves just as well paired with a seared steak or hearty stew as it does completely on its own, enjoyed with a book, movie, or good company.

The seasoned Pork is then smoked in a small-batch rotisserie smoker, using actual hardwood logs (no wood chips, and no liquid smoke). Once cooked, it’s shredded and packaged for Trader Joe’s.   When you open the package at home, you’ll find a pouch inside that you can simply pierce and microwave on a dish for about three minutes.

That’s where you’ll find Trader Joe’s Beef Bulgogi, which our supplier makes with super thinly-sliced beef that’s been marinated in a traditional blend of soy sauce, mirin, and sesame oil, along with onion, garlic, and apple, pear, and pineapple juices.   After a matter of minutes in the microwave, or a touch longer on the stovetop, our Beef Bulgogi is aromatic and umami-rich, with a complex blend of sweet and savory in every tender, toothsome bite. It makes a remarkably easy center-of-the-plate protein option for dinner, especially when served atop a bed of fluffy white rice.

It possesses all the charms of chicken you’ve smoked & pulled yourself—minus all the hours & effort!

gift-bag-for-all-seasons-076669,Gift Bag for All Seasons," Giving may ramp up during the holidays, but there really isn’t a gift-giving “season.” When you consider weddings, graduations, birthdays—plus other holidays throughout the year—opportunities are unlimited for the giving of gifts. This fact prompted us to create Trader Joe’s Gift Bag for All Seasons. These Bags are made from the same durable, hand-washable material as our reusable shopping bags (polypropylene & polyester), but they’re about half the size. And they come in three different designs, each one as festive as it is non-holiday specific.   The black-handled “Pasta” Bag has a white background with yellow pasta shapes—each one next to its handwritten noodle name. The short sides of this bag have the word Pasta repeated in a various of sizes & bold, red type. The red-handled “Party” Bag also has a white background, but this one’s decorated with party- inspired icons, including; party hats, milkshakes, pies, forks, donuts, champagne flutes, and cupcakes—all appearing in shades of red, brown, and lavender. The empty spaces are accented with stars and Trader Joe’s logos. The “Food” Bag also has a red handle, but its background is light-blue underneath darker-blue shadows of oven mitts, teacups, whisks, and forks. Bolder, brightly colored foods appear across the design, including a red tomato, green artichoke, orange butternut squash, hot-pink-iced cupcake, brown ice cream cone, and yellow can of Trader Joe’s Corn—of course!   Trader Joe’s Gift Bags for All Seasons are ready for whatever occasion may be at hand, at any time of the year. It’s up to YOU to choose what gift to put inside... and who will be the lucky giftee!

Second, they mix into that protein an aromatic blend of herbs and spices, including sage, fennel, and garlic & onion powder, so that every bite evokes that unmistakeable, comfort food-classic, diner-style sausage. So, how best to enjoy Trader Joe’s Meatless Breakfast Sausage Patties? However you’d enjoy their animal-protein-based counterparts, we say!

Our Italian Tiramisu has a base of ladyfinger biscuits that are soaked in a combination of coffee and Marsala wine, topped with a thick layer of sweetened mascarpone cheese, and finished with a generous dusting of cocoa powder.

As such, we can whole-heartedly recommend it as an ingredient in soups, sauces, and desserts, as a mix-in for coffee, tea, or cocoa, and, when whipped until light and fluffy, a topping for milkshakes, mousses, or sweet breakfast treats.

Our version of broyé de Poitou (the French “broyé” translates to “crushed”) calls for the same ingredients as the classic recipe—namely, wheat flour, sugar, egg, sea salt, and a smattering of sliced almonds—as well as concentrated butter (essentially, butter that’s had the water and proteins removed via centrifuge), resulting in breathtakingly buttery flavor in every bite.   Offer this French Butter Cookie to your holiday houseguests as a mid-morning or afternoon snack with fresh fruit and a strong cup of French Vanilla Coffee.

This approach concentrates and intensifies the traits derived from each country’s cocoa—which in our case includes cocoa from Venezuela, Vietnam, and Peru. What’s really special about these Chocolates is the opportunity to discern the differences in taste derived from the terroir of each unique location.   Tuck the sheer, elegant bag of 6 Milk Chocolate Batons into someone’s stocking, or gift it to all the chocolate connoisseurs in your life. Why not take advantage of the subtleties found in this Single Origin cocoa and use the Batons to conduct an after-the-meal tasting at your next holiday dinner party.

As Star-shaped cookies in a star-covered box, they’ve earned their seasonal stardom, year after year. Each box is filled with an entire pound of these sublimely satisfying shortbreads, which pair deliciously with a scoop of ice cream or a mug of hot cocoa.

cranberry-butter-cookies-074897,Cranberry Butter Cookies," Trader Joe’s Cranberry Butter Cookies are made for us in France, and their simplicity belies a sophisticated culinary pedigree. The dough starts with wheat flour, sugar, and cultured butter, to which eggs, leavening, and a touch of salt are added to create the classically crumbly, shortbread cookie base. A hint of cinnamon is included for a subtly fragrant, but not overwhelmingly spiced flavor, and sweetened dried cranberries bring a touch of chewy texture and tartness to the party. That’s it!   Brilliantly buttery and not overly sweet, these Cranberry Butter Cookies are a fantastic addition to a holiday cookie platter or cookie exchange, and an intriguing inclusion on a cheese plate and a glass of domething sparkly.

While we always have a vast array of crackers from which to choose, during the winter months, we also offer an astutely assembled cracker assortment by the name of Trader Joe’s Scalloped Cracker Trio, to cover all your entertaining needs.     Flavored in three distinct styles—savory garlic, aromatic rosemary, and delicately spicy chili—each Cracker has an artfully scalloped edge which makes them present particularly well when fanned out around a cheese plate. Texturally, each Cracker is not so delicate as to collapse under the weight of a slice of Figgy Cheddar, nor are they so hearty or heavy as to overpower the flavor of our Creamy Gorgonzola—an ideal balance of structure and crispness, we like to think.

Worried about all the time and effort you’ll have to put in? Porchetta-bout it! For an outrageously delicious, already seasoned, rolled, and bacon-wrapped protein—and a bona fide showstopper, we might add—we suggest serving Trader Joe’s Uncured Bacon Wrapped Porchetta Pork Roast.   It begins with a pork shoulder roast, that's generously rubbed with a meticulously selected blend of herbs and seasonings including garlic, sage, oregano, and rosemary, with a touch of lemon. That roast is rolled and wrapped in uncured bacon – because pork wrapped in pork is magical—and ready to pop into your oven.   Big enough to feed a small crowd, this Bacon Wrapped Porchetta makes a terrific holiday or Sunday dinner entrée. As it cooks in the oven, your house will be filled with the aromas of savory herbs and bacon-y goodness.

josies-mandarins-051316,Josie's Mandarins," In late nineteenth century Europe, oranges were expensive and rare, a special gift given to children in their holiday stockings. And while our Josie’s Mandarins may not be as rare as their predecessors, they’re just as capable of delivering sweetness and sunshine with every bite. Smaller than the standard navel variety, these seedless, handheld orbs possess an easy-to-peel rind and candy-sweet citrus flavor that make them an ideal snack or lunchbox addition for kids and kids-at-heart (and unlike candy, they won’t melt in your purse or pocket). Their juice and zest add delightful complexity to an olive oil cake (visit traderjoes.com for the recipe!). Additionally, their vivid orange hue adds an air of tropical glamour to a centerpiece or gift basket— or, in a nod to history, a stocking!    From roughly November through April, two-pound bags of Josie’s Mandarins in our produce sections will be filled with W. Murcott Mandarins or Tango Mandarins grown in California’s San Joaquin Valley and/or in Marrakesh, Morocco, which just so happens to be the birthplace of the W. Murcott variety. No matter which variety you’ve got on (or in) your hands, you can count on each bag to contain the sweetest, juiciest, seedless Mandarins in town.

vegan-gingerbread-loaf-069009,Vegan Gingerbread Loaf," Some of the first recipes for gingerbread originated in Ancient Greece, over 2,000 years ago. These early versions were a little closer to honey-sweetened flatbreads than the pastry we know today, and they hardly had the architectural utility we currently enjoy in our Gingerbread House Kits, but the point remains: for millennia, people have known that good things happen when you bake ginger into your bread. A few years ago, we reached out to a baker who not only knows ginger, but is also expert at baked goods made without the use of any animal-derived products. They created a loaf to our specifications, and we promptly made the decision to bring it into our stores. And thus, Trader Joe’s Vegan Gingerbread Loaf was born.    This Loaf has everything you’d want in a holiday gingerbread, like rich brown sugar, hearty molasses, and invigorating ginger. You can slice it and serve it right out of the package with a nice hot drink, like our Chocolate Hazelnut Coffee, or, if you’re willing to go the extra mile, give it a quick toast and spread it with your favorite vegan butter or cream cheese.

olive-fougasse-075006,Olive Fougasse," Etymologically derived from the same root word as focaccia, a fougasse is a traditional style of bread originating from southeastern France. Combining the satisfyingly chewy crumb structure of an Italian focaccia with the signature flair of French baking, fougasses where often just as practical as they were palatable, way back when: prior to the widespread use of thermometers, some bakers would use the time it took to fully cook a fougasse to determine how hot an oven was. Now, we can’t speak to the temperature measuring abilities of Trader Joe’s Olive Fougasse, but we can tell you that its crisp, delicious crust, light, airy interior, and generously distributed slices of Kalamata and black olives make for one seriously delicious, anytime bread.   Made in a fetching, four-sectioned design, which can be easily torn or cut into individual servings, our Olive Fougasse makes an excellent accompaniment to practically any meal. It can be served entirely on its own or with a bit of butter for spreading or olive oil for dipping,  and can even be enjoyed as an especially flavorful bread for sandwiches. For an even crispier crust, we suggest giving it 3-4 minutes in the oven at 400°F, just prior to serving.

pecan-pie-028091,Pecan Pie," The mighty Pecan takes its name from a Native American word of Algonquin origin, and while the jury is still out on its preferred pronunciation (pah-KAHN, PEE-can, PEE-kahn—you pick), we think most would agree that its noblest use is in the making of a classic dessert: Pecan Pie.     Trader Joe’s Pecan Pie is an indulgent nod to Southern culinary tradition. Its buttery, brown-sugary base is decidedly sweet, just as a pecan pie should be; its soft, melt-in-your-mouth texture is the ideal counterpoint to the generous amounts of crunchy pecans added to each batch. The Pie is baked just until set, creating a crispy outer crust and a gooey, caramelized center. Serve it warm with a scoop of ice cream for dessert, or alongside a freshly brewed cup of coffee for breakfast. Because who says you can’t have pie for breakfast? Certainly not us.

pine-cone-wreath-023526,Pine Cone Wreath," The holiday wreath is more than just a pretty decoration. Employed by cultures dating back at least as far as ancient Greece, wreaths have been used as a symbol of the changing seasons, fertility, honor, virtue, and eternal life. And you thought it was just festive! At Trader Joe’s, our 22” Pine Cone Wreaths can represent all of those things, if you like. (We think they also represent a terrific value.)     Constructed primarily from lush, gorgeous Fir boughs—the longest-lasting of all needled-greenery—they’re accented with a variety of fragrant sprigs and branches, and finished with hand-picked pine cones. Each Pine Cone Wreath is ready to hang on your door, as-is, or it can be dressed up even further with bows, ribbons, homemade crafts, or other festive trimmings.

(It produces a meditative, fireplace-like Crackling sound as it burns!) Or maybe, just maybe, it was its intoxicating, alluring aroma that lit the flame of fandom—yes, that’s definitely it. With the strike of a match, this Candle fills your space with lush and layered notes of fresh pomegranate, juicy plum, ripe raspberry, and calming cedar—in other words, with the fruity, woodsy scent of Red Fruits in the Forest.   Offering approximately 45 hours of burn time, this Candle has the potential to last you all winter long. It’s perfect for a romantic evening in or as a source of light during a quiet and meditative soak in the bath.

vintage-spiced-ale-2023-084791,Vintage Spiced Ale 2023," Unlike, say, an IPA, Trader Joe's Vintage Ale is not meant to be exclusively drunk fresh, within a month or so of bottling. In fact, it’s a strong, dark, Belgian-style Ale that’s great when it’s fresh, and even better when allowed to mature for months—or even years. The renowned Canadian brewery that made it for us bottles it with fresh yeast, so that the Ale will undergo a second fermentation process. Over time, the yeast will continue to consume sugar, producing more alcohol and carbon dioxide (bubbles!), ultimately yielding an increasingly rich and complex flavor profile of cocoa, citrus, ginger, and other baking spices.   Now, this second fermentation takes place over time, which is why it’s perfectly acceptable—perhaps even preferable—to “age” this beer. Yes, just like a robust red. Aging it is as simple as storing the bottle upright (not on its side, in consideration of the sediment) in a cool, dark place. This is the easy part. The hard part is waiting to enjoy this brew!    But let us be clear, you will certainly enjoy our Vintage Ale if you open it the moment you arrive home from the store (or at least after it's chilled). To enable all the experiences, we recommend picking up at least a few bottles of Trader Joe’s 2023 Vintage Ale—some to enjoy now, and some to mature on the shelf to be opened and enjoyed in 2024 and beyond.

It also makes a mighty tasty, spiked peppermint latte—just add it to hot or iced coffee, sit back, and sip away the cares of the day. We’ve also heard rumors that this one really shines when poured over vanilla ice cream—or blended with vanilla ice cream for a dreamy “adult” milkshake.

Here in the States, they call it Hark and Holly Glühwein. And at Trader Joe's, we call it one of our favorite ways to keep warm during the holidays.   Simply heat a few mugs’ worth of Hark and Holly on the stovetop, then serve to your guests as an aperitif with appetizers (we find its rich, fruity spice is especially suited to cheese and crackers) or as a nightcap at the end of your wintry revels.

peppermint-flavored-baking-chips-076612,Peppermint Flavored Baking Chips," Likely due in large part to its association with candy canes, peppermint is the belle of the holiday flavor ball. Knowing that many peppermint-flavored finds on the market at this time of year often fall short of expectation, our candy buyer worked tirelessly to ensure that Trader Joe’s Peppermint Flavored Baking Chips pack the biggest peppermint punch of the bunch.   Made with plenty of Peppermint oil and rounded out with natural flavor, these Baking Chips also deliver on the candy cane visual: the velvety, snowy white chip base is made with milk powder and sweetened with cane sugar, and the chips are finished with an edible, bright red glitter that gets its hue from vegetable juice. Sure to stand out when baked into cookie dough or brownie batter, these Chips will also add plenty of peppermint flair when melted and drizzled atop a TJ’s Chocolate Lava Cake.

Some backstory: way back in 2013 (Happy 10th Anniversary, Dark Chocolate Peppermint Cremes!), we set out to create a cool, creamy, chocolate-covered, peppermint-flavored candy with a craftily crunchy twist—and the result was an instant TJ’s candy-aisle classic. Mission accomplished. Each Creme is comprised of three key components: a sweet, creamy Peppermint filling, a smooth Dark Chocolate coating, and a sprinkle of crushed candy cane pieces on top, bringing an extra hit of mint and a pleasantly unexpected crunch.

Trader Joe’s Cinnamon Bun Inspired Pancake & Waffle Mix begins with a base we’ve perfected over the years—a pre-measured, pre-mixed recipe, including wheat and malted barley flours, sugar, buttermilk powder, and sea salt. The special “inspiration” comes in the form of craveable, cinnamon & sugar confectionery bits. Inspired even further by a desire to enjoy hot Pancakes & Waffles with minimal effort, we designed this Mix to be just as simple as our others—just add an egg, melted butter, and milk; whisk until combined; then pour some batter on a hot, lightly oiled pan, flip, and voila!

waterless-amaryllis-076407,Waterless Amaryllis," The name Amaryllis comes to us from the Greek verb amarysso, “to sparkle,” and if you’ve ever seen an Amaryllis flower in full bloom, you’ll know precisely why: vivid and vibrant, a single Amaryllis bulb is more than capable of lighting up a whole room. The case could be made, though, that where an Amaryllis truly shines is in its incredible ease of care. Trader Joe’s Waterless Amaryllis Bulbs, for example, need only a little bit of light (natural or artificial) and a relatively stable temperature to bloom, grow, and thrive. That’s because each Bulb contains all the energy an Amaryllis requires to complete its full bloom cycle, so there’s no need for water, soil, or anything other than an appreciative eye to enjoy each flower to its fullest.   Artfully mounted on a decorative cross-section of wood, our Waterless Amaryllis Bulbs are great for bringing a splash of color to your home or office with an absolute minimum of effort. They make an excellent piece of ornamentation for a holiday dinner table or home wintertime display, as well as a lovely gift for anyone with a love for greenery—even (and especially) if they don’t happen to have a green thumb.

gran-reserva-maule-valley-chile-2020-077191,Gran Reserva Maule Valley Chile 2020," One of the first areas in Chile to plant wine-growing grapes, the Maule Valley has since become the country’s premier viticultural region for creating big, bold, and highly complex reds. Situated near the center of Chile’s narrow span, just a little south of Santiago, the Valley is blessed with a relatively cool climate and remarkably fertile soils, both a product of the mighty Maule River’s presence. Conditions like these help grapes develop juicy flavor profiles, strong, supportive tannins, and well-balanced levels of acidity—all of which are expressed most elegantly in Trader Joe’s Gran Reserva Maule Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, Lot 121.   Each sip of this Gran Reserva Cab is rich, robust, and oaky (a result of being aged in French and American oak for a year and a half), with lightly peppery edges that tickle the corners of one’s palate. It’s a fascinating, well-concentrated profile that synergizes spectacularly well with the flavors of grilled meat, pan-fried sausage, or a roast Bacon Wrapped Porchetta. And, of course, since we sell it in our label, it’s also an extreme value. ¡Salud!

stollen-crisps-076627,Stollen Crisps," A beloved holiday bread hailing from Germany, stollen is filled with chopped nuts and dried fruit and generously coated with powdered sugar. Over the centuries, it has become a quintessential wintertime treat, right up there with gingerbread cookies and hot cocoa. It also happens to be the inspiration for our new, limited edition Trader Joe’s Stollen Crisps.   Studded with raisins, orange & lemon peels, and complete with a dusting of snowy-white powdered sugar, these bespoke crackers boast the same ingredients that appear in their beloved namesake. They’re constructed in the style of our customer-favorite Raisin Rosemary Crisps—thin, crispy, and just-a-bit-bigger- than-bite-sized—albeit a tad sweeter, making them ideal pairing partners for Dolce Creamy Gorgonzola Style Cheese or Figgy Cheddar. Want to gild the lily a bit? Use them to scoop up baked Triple Crème Brie topped with chopped dates and fresh rosemary. Of course, they’re flavorful enough to enjoy straight out of the box—one at a time, or (more likely) by the handful.

nordic-reindeer-tillandsia-077163,Nordic Reindeer Tillandsia," A perennial (in all senses of the word) favorite among house plant enthusiasts, you might better know the Tillandsia by its more common name, the air plant. Beloved for its ease of care, the Tillandsia really doesn’t need much: it can thrive perfectly well without ever coming into contact with soil, for instance. It needs only a bit of medium to bright indirect sunlight, or eight hours of medium to bright artificial light. And when it comes to watering, just a light mist once every week or so will keep it happy. All these aspects make the Tillandsia an ideal choice for picking up during the chillier months, which makes Trader Joes Nordic Reindeer Tillandsias an especially apt choice for decorating your hearth and home.   Available just in time for the holiday season, each Tillandsia comes in a charming, Nordic Reindeer- shaped ceramic vessel in one of three wonderfully wintry colors: slate gray, snowy white, or forest green. A great gift for any proud plant parents you may know, or an excellent inclusion for your own home nursery, our Nordic Reindeer Tillandsia are particularly suited for keeping as an office plant. Just be sure to pick up your Reindoor before too long: each air plant may be perennial, but our supplies are decidedly limited.

shimmering-candy-cane-body-butter-076859,Shimmering Candy Cane Body Butter," Just about everything we do here at Trader Joe’s is fueled by our love of food. Our passion for all things edible runs so deep, it even influences our non-food products. Take, for example, Trader Joe’s Shimmering Candy Cane Body Butter. It smells good enough to eat. It even looks good enough to eat. And yet, we implore you not to eat it... because this Butter is for your skin, silly.   Our limited-edition Shimmering Candy Cane Body Butter begins with a classic TJ’s Body Butter base—it’s extra thick, luxurious, and packed with mega-moisturizing ingredients like coconut oil, shea butter, and aloe. It’s the same formula you know and love, but with a twist—a sweet, sparkly, seasonal twist, courtesy of finely ground mica and peppermint oil! The Candy Cane scent is wintry and invigorating, not overpowering, and the shimmer is soft and subtle, not garish or glittery. In other words, it’s a seasonal skincare dream come true.

Each batch starts as a sheet of sumptuously buttery, multi-layered puff pastry, which our supplier tops with a classically French suite of aromatic Herbes de Provence, along with a bit of garlic and onion. The sheets are then cut into Triangles and baked until they’re both crisp and airy, and every bite strikes the ideal balance of rich, savory flavor and light, remarkably flaky texture.   Our Herbes de Provence Triangles are equally excellent as part of an elaborate charcuterie board or cheese plate, as they are when enjoyed as a simple (albeit elegant) anytime snack. Try them as alternatives to pita bread or crackers the next time you’re serving soft and creamy dips, like hummus, Tzatziki, or Garlic Spread-Dip.

olive-wood-spatula-074630,Olive Wood Spatula," Since ancient times, olive branches have been symbols of peace. In Virgil’s epic poem The Aeneid, the olive branch is used to signify the end of the war between Troy and Pallantium, leading to the eventual founding of Rome. In the spirit of peace, prosperity, and, of course, delicious food, we’ve taken these peaceful branches and turned them into something new—namely, into some very handsome housewares, including this nifty, new Trader Joe’s Olive Wood Spatula.   Each year, after the Tunisian olive harvest, the aged trees that no longer produce fruit are removed from their groves. In the spirit of sustainability and skilled craftsmanship, our supplier carves this beautifully grained wood into rustic-yet-refined Spatulas. With their long, narrow handles and elegantly curved blades, they’re perfect for flipping, tossing, turning, stirring, and serving. They also make great gifts—picture a row of stockings, hung by the chimney with care... with stately looking Spatulas sticking out of them. Ah, what a sight.

figgy-cheddar-077098,Figgy Cheddar," Trader Joe’s has a truly awesome assortment of cheeses; we have something special for everyone on your list. Some are everyday all-stars, and some are limited, seasonal sensations, like Trader Joe’s Figgy Cheddar that’s here just for the holidays.   This mild Cheddar is produced for us in Leicestershire, UK, in the heart of the Vale of Belvoir, to be precise. Mini Spanish Figs are marinated in white wine, rum, and a blend of warming spices— like coriander, cinnamon, ginger, fennel, nutmeg, and cloves—then mixed right into the cheese. The result is a creamy, mild Cheddar, studded with marinated Fig pieces. It makes a wonderful addition to a cheeseboard and is superb for snacking. If you’ve ever had apple pie with a slice of Cheddar on top, consider serving with a slice of this Cheddar instead. Pro-tip: this cheese benefits tremendously from being taken out of the refrigerator 30 minutes before serving.

What may surprise you, however, is how those notes mellow with a delicate, sweet (or Dolce, if you speak Italian) finish. It’s the sort of Cheese that offers a different tasting experience with every bite. Before serving, let the wedge sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes. This will help tame the aroma and the texture will soften to an incredibly creamy consistency.   It makes an impressive addition to a cheese board and a fantastic filling for Organic Pitted Medjool Dates. You can even melt it down into a Creamy pasta sauce!

cinnamon-swizzle-sticks-077328,Cinnamon Swizzle Sticks," In our experience, some of the sweetest, warmest moments of wintertime tend to be those we enjoy with a hot mug of coffee, tea, or cocoa in hand. So, what better way could there be to make those moments even sweeter, than with some sweet, pleasantly cinnamon-spiced sugar? That’s precisely what Trader Joe’s Cinnamon Swizzle Sticks offer, while employing a rather ingenious delivery system to do so: they’re made by rolling whole sticks of cinnamon in crunchy rock sugar. When used as a stirring stick (or simply as a festive garnish) for a warm, wintry beverage, they gently sweeten your drink as they dissolve, eventually leaving you a chewy, cinnamon-candy treat to eat right off the cinnamon.   In addition to adding some fun, festive flair to your everyday cup of joe, Trader Joe’s Cinnamon Swizzle Sticks make a great gift for the holiday season, especially for folks on your list with a sweet tooth and a penchant for warm, winter-seasonal beverages.

artichoke-bread-pudding-075528,Artichoke Bread Pudding," Dating back to 11th century Europe, bread pudding was prepared with scraps of leftover bread, water, and sometimes spices or sugar, and consumed when fresh provisions were otherwise unavailable. Fast forward to modern times, and the dish is synonymous with cozy, custard-y comfort food, made with eggs and milk, and enhanced with other sweet or savory ingredients, depending on your mood. At Trader Joe’s, the mood we had in mind when creating our latest Bread Pudding offering was... Artichoke!   Tender, faintly nutty artichokes are the first ingredient in Trader Joe’s Artichoke Bread Pudding—in fact, they comprise more than 20% of the recipe. Our Italian supplier combines them with cubes of hearty Tuscan bread (ideal for soaking up the rich, eggy custard base), plenty of Cheddar cheese, and a host of savory seasonings, like onion, garlic, parsley, and black pepper. Straightforwardly rich and cheesy in the best way, a dash of hot sauce adds intrigue to the recipe, allowing this craveable casserole to stand on its own as a vegetarian main dish or an equally inspired side.

something-spritzy-076687,Something Spritzy," Sometimes you’re in the mood for a festive beverage—you know, the spritzy, sparkling kind—but you’re not in the mood for wine or other spirits. And you don’t quite want a soda, either. Well, we had you and your mocktail moods in mind when we created Trader Joe’s Something Spritzy, our sensational new Sparkling Festive Beverage!   It’s made with grapefruit, cranberry, and orange juices from concentrate. Of course, if it was just fruit juices with bubbles, then it would simply be sparkling juice. But with a stimulating, spirit-free sip in mind, we’ve added some aromatic bitter flavors and a touch of cane sugar. The contrast of the sweet and tart fruit juices with the herbal bitter flavors, all buoyed by tiny bubbles, creates a profile complex enough to convince your palate it’s ‘not just juice,’ yet refreshing enough to beckon, sip, after sip, after sip... What’s more, at 17 grams of sugar per can, it’s a welcome change of pace from the saccharine soda options you might encounter at a holiday cocktail party. You’ll find Something Spritzy on the shelves with the other bottled beverages at your neighborhood Trader Joe’s, making spirits bright (sans spirits) through the holiday season.

raspberry-croissant-carre-077043,Raspberry Croissant Carré," Made for us in California by the best boulangers we’ve found this side of the Atlantic, Trader Joe’s Raspberry Croissant Carré starts, as all good things do, with a classic laminated dough (a.k.a. dough that’s been repeatedly folded with layers of butter to create the flaky Croissant eating experience). The dough is paired with a tart Raspberry filling that’s been sweetened with a bit of sugar and complemented with a touch of lemon juice to further amplify the fruit. But rather than rolling them into the classic Croissant shape, the layers of dough are sandwiched around the jammy filling, like a coffee cake—a sedimentary construction that allows for the inclusion of much more filling than you’d find in an individual croissant. Merveilleux!   Sprinkled with coarse sugar crystals and baked until the dough reaches a lovely, deep golden hue, this impressive Carré (that’s French for “square,” a nod to this pastry’s squarish shape) serves six. Pick one up from the bakery shelf at your neighborhood Trader Joe’s and enjoy right out of the package—it’s a fantastic slice-and-serve option for a breakfast meeting or weekend brunch, paired with a steaming cup of coffee. To attain maximum deliciousness, remove the outer packaging and warm the Carré in a 350°F oven—you’ll be rewarded with a fresh, French-style pastry, without the upscale bakery price tag you might find elsewhere.

Whatever it is, it’s one heck of a flavor profile, and with Trader Joe’s Iced Gingerbread Squares, we’ve packed all that flavor and then some into six, craveable quadrilaterals.   Our supplier—who happens to be a bit of an expert in the field of festive baked goods—crafts these sweet Squares with butter, brown sugar, and, of course, ground ginger, plus cinnamon, allspice, and a bit of lemon purée for extra zing. They’re super-soft-baked, delightfully chewy, and topped with confectioner’s icing and a sprinkle of sanding sugar for textural interest. Simply let your Iced Gingerbread Squares thaw at room temperature for about an hour (or, alternatively, in the fridge for 3-4 hours), and you’ve got dessert!

gran-capitan-hard-cheese-with-black-olive-paste-076858,Gran Capitan Hard Cheese with Black Olive Paste," Among Spain’s many contributions to the culinary world, Spanish cheeses and Spanish olives may be among their best. Our latest Spotlight Cheese, Gran Capitan Oliva Negra, is a savory salute to these two Spanish specialties. Made by the same supplier as previous Spotlight entry Gran Capitan Reserva, Gran Capitan Oliva Negra follows its predecessors’ suit in being made with a mix of multiple kinds of milk, this time combining cow, sheep, and goat for a complex range of creaminess, nuttiness, and tartness. Where it truly sets itself apart, however, is in the introduction of rich veins of briny black olive paste, which brings on a whole other level of umami-forward flavors to every bite.   As the largest producer of olives on the planet, providing roughly half the world’s olive oil every year, Spain is well celebrated for its olives, and Gran Capitan Oliva Negra feels like a celebration in and of itself. We find that its easy, Manchego-like texture and assertive flavors of olive make it an ideal inclusion for any charcuterie board or cheese plate. We recommend pairing it up with some fresh, sliced stonefruit, a handful of Rosemary Marcona Almonds, and, if you’d really like to enjoy the full expression of the Spanish olive experience, a light drizzle of our Spanish Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil. ¡Buen provecho!

Use it to toast the occasion at a holiday feast with extended family, serve it during a nice weekend dinner with just those closest to you, or even just sip it slowly as a flavorful, post-work pick-me-up.

empanadas-de-ropa-vieja-076647,Empanadas de Ropa Vieja," Ropa vieja is a much-adored entrée, globally, with variations in a multitude of cultures across the Americas, the Iberian Peninsula, and the Philippines. It’s particularly treasured within the culinary canon of Cuba, where it is celebrated as the country’s national dish. So named for its resemblance to old, torn-up clothing, the Cuban version of ropa vieja is typically made with shredded beef stewed in a rich, tomato-based sauce, along with onions, bell peppers and a savory suite of satisfyingly zesty spices. That’s the approach our supplier in Florida— the capital of Cuban cuisine within the U.S., we might add—takes with Trader Joe’s Empanadas de Ropa Vieja, which recontextualizes this classic dish into the cozy confines of a crisp, cassava-based pastry crust.   And since our supplier has done all that work for you, all you need to do to enjoy these estimable Empanadas is heat them, from frozen, in your oven for about 15 minutes, or your air fryer for about 10. From there, you’re free to enjoy them as an effortless appetizer along with your favorite dipping sauce—we find that their rich, hearty flavor and mix of tender and crispy textures take especially well to the herby, slightly spicy notes of our Chimichurri Sauce, for instance. Or, if you’re more in the mood for a full meal, enjoy them alongside some well-seasoned rice and Organic Black Beans.

(Fun fact: cornicabra means “goat’s horn,” as the olives used to produce this revered oil are oval-shaped, with a small horn on one side.) The oil lends a robust, pleasantly bitter flavor and green, grassy aromas, that produce a particularly unique and delicious eating experience when paired with the mild, nutty flavors of the Aged Sheep’s Milk Cheese.

They are 100% antibiotic-free and come from crate-free, vegetarian-fed pigs that have never been given hormones. They’re considered Uncured because they contain no added nitrates or nitries, except what’s naturally present in celery and sea salt.    Unlike our Turkeys, our Hams are fully cooked and conveniently Spiral Sliced, which allows the meat to stay on the bone until you remove it with the simple twist of a fork. They require no seasoning, no stuffing, no basting—and almost no prep. Simply unwrap the Ham, place it on a tray or roasting pan, and heat it in a 275°F oven, ready to enjoy in just about two hours.    And though you definitely don’t have to do anything to the Ham when it's in the oven, we’ve included an optional spiced glaze for those who still miss the basting!  ","['Food', 'Meat, Seafood & Plant-based', 'Beef, Pork & Lamb']",https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/fully-cooked-spiral-sliced-uncured-half-ham-075337,$5.99,1 Lb,https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m20801/75337.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280,Antibiotic Free,"['UNCURED HAM PREPARED WITH: WATER', 'CONTAINS 2% OR LESS OF SALT', 'VINEGAR', 'TURBINADO SUGAR', 'CULTURED CELERY POWDER', 'CHERRY POWDER', 'GLAZE PACKET INGREDIENTS: CANE SUGAR, SPICES, CANOLA OIL.']",,"['Effortless Entertaining', 'Fall Faves', 'Family Style', 'Merry-making', 'Time-pressed']",['3 oz glazed ham(84g)'],['130 ']

What’s more, this Salami is Uncured, containing no added nitrates or nitrites, except what’s naturally present in celery and sea salt. Benissimo!   To serve this Finocchiona Uncured Salami, slit the inedible casing with a knife along the base, then lengthwise, and peel the casing to expose only the portion you’d like to eat.

spanish-style-uncured-chorizo-075553,Spanish Style Uncured Chorizo," If you’re looking to up your charcuterie game, especially heading into the holidays, Trader Joe’s Spanish Style Uncured Chorizo can help. Unlike Mexican style chorizo, which is typically raw and needs to be cooked before eating (like TJ’s Soy Chorizo), Spanish Style Chorizo is more like a typical salami, ready to eat right out of the package.   To make this Spanish Style Chorizo, our Chicago supplier starts with heritage-breed pork, with no added hormones, and no antibiotics, ever. It’s also crate-free pork, which means the animals were not restrained in gestation and farrowing crates.

organic-conversation-olive-trio-075960,Organic Conversation Olive Trio," Two of the things we love most in the world are great food and great conversation. So, what about a great food that facilitates great conversation? Well, now you’re really talking. That’s why we’re so abuzz about Trader Joe’s Organic Conversation Olives. Brought to us by a supplier in Italy, who sources their Organic Olives from Puglia (the “heel” of Italy’s “boot”), each jar contains a mix of three distinctly delicious varieties of Olive: bold, buttery, and bright green Nocellara; tender, super savory, and reddish-green Bella di Cerignola; and mild, toothsome, and reddish-purple Leccino.   Together, this carefully curated trio can be enjoyed in all kinds of scenarios, from a cocktail party hors d’oeuvre table, to a date night charcuterie plate, to even a simple, anytime, right-out-of-the-fridge snack. However, we like them best when employed as their name implies: as a consummate Conversation starter. Keep a jar on hand to idly snack on whenever a friend comes over to chat. Serve them alongside a nice cheese for an elevated after-work or after-school treat while catching up with a loved one. And if you prefer to snack solo, might we suggest pairing them with one of the compelling conversations featured on our podcast, Inside Trader Joe’s?

It turns out that these normally unassuming grains make a pretty miraculous milk alternative in general, and a great base for vegan coffee creamer in particular, as Trader Joe’s Non-Dairy Cinnamon Bun Oat Creamer demonstrates.   Made with the same dairy-free, lactose-free, and gluten-free base as our Non-Dairy Brown Sugar Oat Creamer, this limited-edition, vegan Oat Creamer changes the non-dairy game further still. Its unbelievably smooth, velvety consistency is pitch-perfect for dressing up coffees and teas, both hot and iced, while its fragrant Cinnamon flavor adds cozy warmth and pleasantly sweet depth wherever it’s poured. In addition to its more obvious uses, try mixing it with a bit of ground flax to make a custard soak for Vegan Brioche French toast, or drizzling it over a bowl of still-warm baked apple crisp for creamy, cooling contrast.

Trader Joe’s Italian Black Summer Truffle Slices in Olive Oil, for example, excel at adding a remarkable depth of umami-forward flavor and alluring, truffle aromas to the kinds of hearty pastas, creamy soups, and roasted proteins that define wintertime comfort food. Exclusively available during the winter season, this tasty take on a classic carpaccio di tartufo has plenty to offer for fans of rich truffle flavor—and all for a fraction of the price you’d pay elsewhere.   Our supplier in Italy packs these razor-thin, texturally delicate slices of Black Summer Truffle in pure, relatively mild Olive Oil, rather than EVOO, which helps keep the truffle flavor front and center. They can be added directly from the jar to everything from pizza to pan-seared salmon, omelets to avocado toast, or breaded chicken cutlets to bubbly, béchamel-based lasagnas. They make an excellent gift option for any truffle-fervent foodies on your list, as well as an able accompaniment to a charcuterie board during a romantic dinner date at home. Just be sure to pick up a jar before winter’s end—supplise are limited, and at this price, these Truffle Slices in Olive Oil won’t stay on the shelves for too long!

That’s where your neighborhood Trader Joe’s comes in, in general, and with Braised Pork Shoulder in a Fig & Apricot Sauce, in particular.   Cooked sous vide (that is, cooked vacuum-sealed in a warm water bath) for more than 12 hours, this mouthwateringly moist Pork Shoulder takes the guesswork out of main dish musings with aplomb. It’s covered in a sweetly complex Fig & Apricot Sauce, its tangy stone fruit and balsamic flavors deftly complementing the savory garlic and onion, all of which elevate the Pork Shoulder to new heights. With notes of black pepper and coriander, it’s well-paired with a glass of spice-forward Pontificis GSM. Perhaps most impressively, it manages to be exceedingly tender without falling apart, allowing you to slice and serve it as an effortlessly fancy focal point on a plate of fluffy mashed potatoes and crisp salad greens. Dinner is served, indeed!   Averaging about 1.5 pounds in size, Trader Joe’s Braised Pork Shoulder in a Fig & Apricot Sauce heats in a 350°F oven in about 20 minutes—and if time is of the essence, you can microwave it in about eight minutes.

In fact, they’re already so naturally hearty and satisfyingly starchy, that they only require a little seasoning to become something truly spectacular. It’s a phenomenon that’s evident in every bite of Trader Joe’s Herbes de Provence Potato Wedges, a frozen side dish that makes the simple pleasures of crisp, herby potatoes and makes it even simpler: just heat, serve, and enjoy!   Each bag is made with a mix of two golden potato varietals, Melody and Agata, which our supplier cuts into bite-sized Wedges before seasoning with olive oil and a classic Herbes de Provence blend that includes oregano, savory, rosemary, basil and thyme. They then roast them until they’re just crisp on the outside and creamy on the inside, then flash freeze them, allowing you to finish them at home with just a few minutes in the oven or air fryer. We find that they make an indispensable addition to practically any meal, especially as a side to your favorite full-flavored protein.

That’s because, generally- speaking, the multi-faceted flavor profile of Pinot Noir pairs well with traditional Thanksgiving fare. Our latest Grand Reserve Pinot Noir from Santa Lucia Highlands further promotes this Thanksgiving-Pinot Noir partnership.   This 2021 vintage was cultivated during a cooler growing season. The mild temperatures, overnight fog, and afternoon winds in Monterey County (where Santa Lucia Highlands AVA is located), brought forth fuller grape development, and preserved acid levels in the fruit. This yielded intense, multi-dimensional fruit flavors and textures in the wine. You’ll experience notes of blueberry/boysenberry, nutmeg, rich cocoa, vanilla, and brown sugar on the nose. On the sip, flavors of sage, raspberry, rhubarb, and cherry emerge. Now think about your holiday menu: do you recognize any points of connection?

vintjs-sonoma-county-chardonnay-2021-077884,VINTJS Sonoma County Chardonnay 2021," A VINTJS wine is an expression of time and place, bottled in limited quantity. Allow us, then, to break down this VINTJS 2021 Chardonnay: The distinctive microclimates across Sonoma County—the place, if you will—elicit a wide range of flavors from its impressive plantings of Chardonnay grapes. The 2021 vintage— the time those grapes were harvested—was expertly blended to achieve a Chardonnay that exhibits well- integrated notes of pear and red apple atop a creamy palate, with a light mineral quality. Bright gold in color, this wine offers a nice acidity balanced with toasty oak notes, a perfect match for the wide range of flavors on offer come Thanksgiving Day. Turkey and stuffing aside, it’s also an excellent sidekick to creamy pasta dishes, steamed fish, or a buttery, triple crème brie.   Your neighborhood Trader Joe’s is the place for expressions of our commitment to value on excellent wine, and the time is now: we’re offering 750mL bottles of VINTJS 2021 Sonoma County Chardonnay, until the time has passed!

thanksgiving-stuffing-seasoned-popcorn-077100,Thanksgiving Stuffing Seasoned Popcorn," Of all the myriad flavors and foods associated with Thanksgiving, we truly have a soft spot for stuffing. There’s just something about stuffing’s rich, aromatic, and sensationally savory seasonings that have always seemed to evoke the very essence of autumn, to us—with or without the context of a holiday feast. A few years ago, we put that philosophy into practice with the introduction of our now-iconic Thanksgiving Stuffing Seasoned Kettle Chips, the first of our stuffing-centered snacks. Now, we’re excited to introduce our next foray into the stuffing frontier: Trader Joe’s Thanksgiving Stuffing Seasoned Popcorn.   A treat for any fan of fall flavors, each batch is made with light, airy, butterfly-style kernels of Popcorn, which are seasoned with a seasonally-appropriate blend of spices that includes celery seed, thyme, parsley, black pepper, and sage. In addition to making an excellent movie snack, school lunch bring-along, or simple, anytime indulgence, we find that this superbly savory Stuffing Seasoned Popcorn is a great addition to any Thanksgiving hors d’oeuvre table.

guatemala-la-morena-peaberry-small-lot-coffee-075106,Guatemala La Morena Peaberry Small Lot Coffee," One typically hears the term “terroir” used exclusively in relation to wine—and yet, this concept of climate and terrain being indicative of flavor is just as applicable to coffee. The beans in each bag of our limited-edition Trader Joe’s Guatemala La Morena Peaberry Small Lot Coffee, for example, hail from the women-owned La Morena collective of farms, situated near the city of Huehuetenango in western Guatemala. Here, the region’s warm, humid, subtropical climate and lush, limestone soils make ideal growing conditions for crafting this rich, chocolatey, and superlatively smooth coffee—the kind that conjures the character of its terroir with every satisfying sip.   In addition to its impressive provenance, the makers of this Small Lot Coffee have also ensured that each bag contains only the very best of the very best coffee beans from their harvest. While there are usually two beans in each coffee cherry, approximately 5% of coffee crops yield Peaberry beans, which are smaller and prized for their concentrated flavors. In these Peaberry beans, those flavors express themselves as dark chocolate, ripe blackberry, and a sweet, cozy finishing note of brown sugar. We recommend enjoying each cup in a context where you can slowly savor every sip, like paired with a flaky pastry, avocado toast, or a few squares of our Dark Chocolate Bar with Almonds.

But instead of being hard like dried pasta, these Pillows are exquisitely crisp with an incredibly satisfying crunch that results from the marriage of coarsely milled durum wheat and our Sardinian suppliers’ baking method.   The outside is of each Crisp is seasoned with salt & natural flavors that lend a red-orange hue, with a subtly herby, tomato-y flavor that recalls... well... PIZZA!

classic-bitters-075641,Classic Bitters," Bitters are an aromatic flavoring agent, made from infusing any combination of fruit peels, spices, herbs, barks or flowers in high-proof alcohol. Historically reputed to have medicinal properties, they were once prescribed as cure-alls for headaches, stomachaches, indigestion, and cramps. Fast-forward to modern day usage, however, and you can think of bitters as a bartender’s “salt-and-pepper,” a liquid seasoning of sorts that adds depth and nuance that really tie a drink together.   Trader Joe’s Classic Bitters are aromatic and complex, with strong notes of clove, cinnamon, and herbs. They’re made exclusively for us in downtown Los Angeles at the first licensed distillery since Prohibition. A bottle of Classic Bitters is befitting of any bar setup and is made without the use of artificial flavors or coloring, which can’t be said for similar products out in the market.   The aforementioned process of infusing botanicals into alcohol to create these Bitters can take anywhere from days to weeks, requiring careful testing along the way to ensure the desired flavor and quality of the end product. With Trader Joe’s Classic Bitters, the work has been done for you, so all you have to do is open the bottle and add them to your drink of choice—Old Fashioned, anyone? And if cocktails aren’t your calling, fret not—there are plenty of other uses for bitters.

cornbread-mix-032809,Cornbread Mix," This is a classic Trader Joe’s product that’s been earning its place on our shelves for close to 20 years. Trader Joe’s Cornbread Mix bakes up to a cake-y, crumbly texture, with a sweet flavor profile that’s amplified by the addition of actual corn kernels in the mix – the corn adds a bit of chew to the texture, too.   Preparing this Mix couldn’t be easier—simply beat an egg with 3/4 cup milk and 1/2 cup oil, then stir in the mix, just until moistened. Pour the batter into a greased 8x8-inch square pan, and then bake! With a simple spread of whipped butter or a drizzle of honey, you’ll be in cornbread heaven in no time (okay, some time – about 35 minutes). You could also spoon the batter into a muffin pan for single-serve Cornbread muffins that are excellent paired with Organic Vegetarian Chili.

handcrafted-felted-wool-pumpkin-076663,Handcrafted Felted Wool Pumpkin," The secret’s out: at Trader Joe’s, we are quite fond of felt. Or perhaps it was never a secret at all—every year come fall, our household products section runneth over with fun, festive fare made from fine, Felted Wool. And to think, it all started with dryer balls... or, to be specific, it all started in 2018, when our Buyer took a trip to Nepal and encountered a supplier who specializes in creating housewares out of hand-felted New Zealand wool. Impressed, she brought back a bag of Felted Wool Dryer Balls to present to our panel, and the rest is history.   This fall, we’ve expanded our assortment of felted wool items even further with Trader Joe’s Handcrafted Felted Wool Pumpkins. These medium-sized, felted Cucurbitae peponēs (a.k.a. field pumpkins, for all you plant and produce nerds out there) come in three different colors: green, white, and, of course, classic orange. They have all the charm of regular pumpkins, minus the limited shelf-life—these gourd-geous gourds were built, er, felted t o last. Quantities are limited, so pick one up at your neighborhood Trader Joe’s today and let the felt fest begin!

organic-farfalle-rigate-pasta-075723,Organic Farfalle Rigate Pasta," Named after the Italian word for “butterflies”, and also known in other parts of Italy as strichetti (“bow ties”), Farfalle are far and away one of our very favorite pasta shapes. While their resemblance to pollinators and pieces of neckwear is certainly charming, they also serve a purpose beyond simple aesthetics: both the ruffled edges of the “wings” and the pinched point in the middle help each piece of Farfalle hold on to sauces and oils, and thus deliver more flavor with every bite. Made for us by the same expert Italian pasta manufacturer as many of our celebrated, limited-run, organic pastas, Trader Joe’s Organic Farfalle Rigate takes this design philosophy one step further, via the introduction of radiating ridges (hence, “Rigate”) on every piece.   In addition to providing an even more satisfyingly toothsome texture (especially when cooked al dente), these ridges also make their bronze-die-cut Farfalle Rigate that much better at holding our Basil Pesto, Creamy Tomato Basil Pasta Sauce, or any other pasta sauce you choose to toss them in. While we find that they’re especially suited for richer, creamier sauces, the truth is, you really can’t go wrong with Farfalle of this quality. Even just a bit of your favorite TJ’s olive oil, minced garlic, and crushed red chili peppers will make a fantastic Farfalle aglio e olio. Just be sure to pick up a package while you can: supplies are limited, and we wouldn’t be at all surprised if these Organic Farfalle fly off the shelves before too long.

organic-clove-powder-076891,Organic Clove Powder," At Trader Joe’s, we’re committed to traveling the culinary seas to bring our customers unique spice blends, as well as single-ingredient spices at an incredible value. And this holiday season, we’re really spicing things up with our new, limited Trader Joe’s Organic Clove Powder. This pungent powder begins as whole Cloves, which themselves begin as flower buds on Myrtaceae evergreen trees in Sri Lanka. The Cloves are harvested before the flowers bloom, then dried; finally, the little buds are finely ground to create our Organic Clove Powder.   Clove is a warming spice (like cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg), intensely aromatic with balanced sweet and bitter flavors. A common ingredient in Chinese five-spice blends and chai recipes, it works well in both sweet and savory applications (not to mention, it’s an essential component of our very own Pumpkin Pie Spice). Try adding Organic Clove Powder to meat marinades, or sprinkling it on Delicata Squash before roasting. Or stir a teaspoon into cookie dough or Buttermilk Pancake & Baking Mix for a surprise punch of spice. Further highlight its zingy warmth in mulled wine or a hot toddy. Or simply sprinkle it to your satisfaction over a slice of pie or a mug of hot cocoa topped with fluffy whipped cream.

dutch-griddle-cakes-074741,Dutch Griddle Cakes," What’s the difference between a pancake and a griddle cake? In certain parts of the world, the two are more or less synonymous. But when and where they do differ, it’s largely a matter of height: while a typical pancake tends to be rather thin, griddle cakes are usually considerably thicker, with a springier, slightly chewier texture that’s comparable to a Crumpet. That certainly fits the bill for our frozen, fully-cooked, and ready- to-heat Trader Joe’s Dutch Griddle Cakes. They’re made for us by a supplier in the Netherlands, who crafts each Cake to a luxuriously lofty stature, creating an altogether elevated breakfast option.   The best part? These sweet, tasty Griddle Cakes take only a few minutes in the oven or toaster—or mere seconds in the microwave—before they’re ready to be topped with a pat of butter, a swirl of Organic Maple Syrup, and a generous dollop of whipped cream.

veggies-greens-salad-kit-060984,Veggies & Greens Salad Kit," A few words of explanation… At Trader Joe’s, we’re known for the clever, creative names we come up with for our products…well, some of our products. We thought we’d take a moment to explain what we mean by “Veggies and Greens Salad Kit.” “Veggies” is short for vegetables, and “Greens” is a common way to refer to different forms of lettuce, which are technically leaf vegetables. So, this could have been called “Veggies and Veggies Salad Kit,” but then we would lose the familiar comfort of using a colloquialism like “greens.” We decided to go with “Veggies and Greens Salad.”   Trader Joe’s Veggies and Greens Salad Kit is a combination of chopped broccoli, shaved cauliflower, shaved Brussels sprouts, radicchio, green cabbage, and kale. Since this is a complete salad kit, these vegetables are ac- companied by pistachios, dried pear crumbles, and a honey ginger dressing to create a salad that’s expectedly healthy and delightfully delicious without being too self-righteous.   Terrific on its own, or as a side dish, this Salad has Asian-influenced flavors that go well with all sorts of main entrées, like Garlic Peppercorn Pork Tenderloin, broiled chicken, or salmon. It’s also a unique way to serve cruciferous veggies throughout their peak season.

1000-day-gouda-cheese-097274,1000 Day Gouda Cheese," When it comes to cheese, we don’t just talk the talk. We walk the walk. Or rather, we ride the planes, trains, boats, whatever means of conveyance we can, really, to find amazing cheeses from all over the world. We take our cheeses seriously, and we know our customers do too, so we’re willing to trek wherever necessary to find the real deal.   For one stop in our cheese-fueled world tour, we visited the Netherlands, the iconic home of windmills, tulip booms, and Trader Joe’s 1,000 Day Gouda Cheese. It was there that we found the veteran cheese makers who hold the secret to ideal affinage—the art of caring for aging cheese—necessary for aging Gouda for such a prolonged period of time. During the maturation process, the cheese loses close to a quarter of its original weight, as its moisture content slowly but surely evaporates, condensing its naturally salty, caramel-y, and supremely savory flavor profile, without drying out completely. It’s an intricate balance, and one that produces an unbelievably flavorful cheese.   It’s a long journey from the Dutch aging cellars to our cheese case, but it’s a journey well worth taking. It’s a delicious enough cheese that you may just find yourself idly snacking on it (we certainly won’t judge), but if you’re in the mood for a more organized setting, we recommend serving this Gouda as part of a dessert cheese plate, paired with a full-flavored Barolo wine, or as part of the most intense grilled cheese sandwich you’ve ever eaten.

ciabatta-rolls-097438,Ciabatta Rolls," Not so very long ago, in 1982, a man in Verona, Italy invented ciabatta bread. He decided the loaf looked quite like his wife’s slippers (the English translation of ciabatta), and so bread named after footwear was born. Even more recently, we decided to start selling such bread, like Trader Joe’s Ciabatta Rolls (even though these are more like miniature slippers).   Ciabatta dough contains a high moisture content—over 70% in this case—giving it a thin, slightly caramel- ized crust and a light crumb with large holes. Better yet, it’s made with just a few ingredients: unbleached wheat flour, water, sea salt, yeast, and malted barley. Though our supplier makes large quantities of bread, they are still able to achieve the sought-after artisanal taste and texture. And, really, what’s more artisan than miniature versions of an esteemed artisan bread?   Dip these tasty rolls to your heart’s content, perhaps in Sicilian Selezione Extra Virgin Olive Oil and Balsamic Vinegar of Modena. Make little panini sandwiches with mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil. Or, go the traditional route: use it to soak up extra sauce after a heaping bowl of spaghetti—ciabatta is famous for its ability to be dipped without falling apart. For a crispy crust, place the bread in a 400˚F oven for a few minutes.

roasted-hatch-chile-jalapeno-cheese-dip-076968,Roasted Hatch Chile & Jalapeño Cheese Dip," Where does one even begin to recommend occasions for Trader Joe’s Roasted Hatch Chile & Jalapeño Cheese Dip? Perhaps one starts from the premise that any occasion can be vastly improved by the addition of a superlatively creamy, remarkably cheesy, and sensationally spicy appetizer Dip, and goes from there. Even with that in mind, we must say that this particular Dip surpasses all expectation. Made with a base of sour cream, cream cheese, and Cheddar, and flavored with fiery, roasted Hatch chiles and jalapeños, it heats up to a magnificently molten texture after just a few minutes in the microwave (or a smidge longer in your conventional oven), at which point it scoops spectacularly well with tortilla chips, baguette slices, or your favorite fresh veggies.

With their well-balanced blend of spicy and sweet, they’re great companions to all kinds of savory proteins—we’re especially partial to pairing them with one of our pre-marinated options, like our Sesame Teriyaki Beef Skirt Steak, or something vegan and filling, like our Sriracha Flavored Baked Tofu.

cinnamon-sugar-toffee-trio-076886,Cinnamon Sugar Toffee Trio," Toffee is essentially butter and sugar that’s been carefully cooked until caramelized and crunchy. Sometimes, almonds or chocolate are added. Our new Toffee Trio brings even more to the party: a variety of chocolatey flavors, plus the nostalgia of cinnamon-sugar.   We commissioned some toffee experts to construct these candies—the same experts who make Trader Joe’s English Toffee with Nuts. (Fun fact: “English” is a style of toffee, not an indication of where the toffee is made.) They begin with bite-sized pieces of English toffee (including crushed almonds), which are then covered in one of three chocolatey options: dark, milk, or white chocolate. Each piece is then sprinkled all over with a mixture of cinnamon and sugar. The result is a treat that hints at autumn the moment it’s lifted to your mouth. Beyond that sugary cinnamon, one will also experience the smooth taste of chocolate, leading up to a tried-and-true toffee crunch with all of the anticipated buttery richness.   Toffee lovers will find plenty to love in our Cinnamon Sugar Toffee, and if you’re among those who’ve yet to experience the delights that toffee can bring, this is your chance to discover true toffee joy!

avocado-ranch-salad-kit-072567,Avocado Ranch Salad Kit," When we set out to create one of our all-in-one salad kits, sometimes it comes down to simply testing out a theory. For example: just on a conceptual level alone, the mild, lightly grassy flavor and remarkably creamy texture of avocado should make it a natural companion to the savory, herby sensations of a classic ranch dressing. We put that theory into practice with Trader Joe’s Avocado Ranch Salad Kit, by compiling a collection of fresh, crisp, shredded leafy greens and veggies, savory, grated Cheddar, and crunchy, lightly salted corn chips to act as a canvas for a captivaingly creamy ranch dressing made with a base of buttermilk and avocados. As it turns out, that theory was delightfully, deliciously correct. Don’t you just love the scientific method?   Like all our salad kits, this Avocado Ranch is a super quick and convenient way to add a side salad to practically any meal. It’s a proven winner with pizza, a beauty with barbecue, and a certified sensation, even with something as simple as a sandwich. Or, if you’d prefer it as an entrée, just pop your favorite protein on top, an voilà—you’ve got a whole meal on your hands.

You might wrap a piece of Dough around a Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup and bake for a sweet surprise, or roll it flat and break out the cookie cutters for an edible art project.

honey-hydration-day-night-cream-duo-076810,Honey Hydration Day & Night Cream Duo," When it comes to scene-stealing skin, it’s all about the Hydration, honey! Or rather, it’s all about the hydration properties inherent in Honey, hence why honey-infused skincare products are all the rage right now. Curious to see what the buzz is all about, our Buyer tested out a popular honey face cream for herself, and while she was impressed with the results, she was decidedly unimpressed with the price tag. She knew we could do better, so she put on her worker bee hat, headed to the hive (a.k.a. the headquarters of one of our favorite skincare suppliers), and in no time at all, the plans for Trader Joe’s Honey Hydration Day & Night Cream Duo had crystallized...   Our limited-edition Trader Joe’s Honey Hydration Day & Night Cream Duo affords all the sweet, skin- softening benefits of high-end honey skincare, minus the not-so-sweet, high-end price tag. The lightweight Day Cream is made with hyaluronic acid, aloe leaf juice, and arnica & chamomile flower extracts; the mega- moisturizing Night Cream contains shea butter, sweet almond oil, sea buckthorn; and both are packed with real Manuka honey and skin-protecting ceramides. When it comes to beauty, it is, of course, what’s on the inside that counts — but it doesn’t hurt that this Duo comes packaged in cute, honeycomb-inspired, hexagonal glass jars, stacked together in an adorably bee-dazzled, stocking stuffer-sized gift box.

wicked-good-mini-chocolate-bars-074622,Wicked Good Mini Chocolate Bars," According to historians, trick-or-treating traces its origins to a 16th-century custom in Scotland and Ireland known as “guising.” Back then, children (and a few adults) would don costumes and go to door-to-door asking for fruit, baked goods, or money in exchange for reciting poetry (an aspect we are, arguably, spared from in the modern era). While it wasn’t until the early 20th century that the practice and the phrase “trick or treat” were popularized in North America, it’s clear that the desire to give and get candy on a chilly autumn night has been with us for a long, long time. Which is precisely why we’re proud to finally get in on the game with Trader Joe’s Wicked Good Mini Chocolate Bars!   Each bag contains 24 Mini-sized milk Chocolate Bars in four different varieties of fillings: sweet and fluffy Nougat, gooey and chewy Nougat & Caramel; satisfyingly crunchy Peanut & Caramel, and delightfully crisp Caramel & Wafer. They’re individually wrapped, so they’re easy to hand out to trick-or-treaters on Halloween, or take a few with you wherever you need to go. They make a Wicked Good movie snack, a perfectly portioned school lunch dessert, and a fun, festive inclusion to a communal candy bowl at home or the office.

In advance of Dios de los Muertos, our plants & flowers section is annually populated with a shrub-filled skull selection that only continues to expand. The latest is Trader Joe’s Sugar Skull with Premium Foliage.   First, it’s important to note that although these are called “Sugar Skulls,” they are not actually made of sugar. The name is just a reference to the tradition of giving edible skull treats made from cane sugar to sweet-toothed children in celebration of the Day of the Dead. In fact, these Sugar Skulls are ceramic, and definitely not meant to eaten. They are, however, definitely meant to be filled with Premium plants—and that’s just what we’ve done!   You’ll find these ceramic Skulls in our Plants & Flowers section displaying a variety of foliage, including Philodendron, Peperomia, and Calathea plant varieties. We have a West Coast and an East Coast grower, so specific plants will vary, depending on your Trader Joe’s location. Each houseplant is long-lasting with proper care, and the decorative Skull planters will make a unique statement on display in your home. Pick up all three Sugar Skull colors (including: blue with cream trim, black with white trim, and white with black trim)—or choose your favorite to pair with the rest of your Trader Joe’s Skull collection!

Each one is made with a soft, whole wheat tortilla that’s packed with fluffy egg whites, wilted spinach, and briny bits of feta cheese, along with a zesty, savory, sun-dried tomato spread. It’s the kind of bold, breakfast mashup you’d find on the menu at a fancy brunch spot, with one key difference—it’s available at your neighborhood Trader Joe’s, and for a fraction of a typical brunch spot’s price.   Not only is it a remarkable value, it’s super convenient too: all it takes is a few minutes in the microwave, and you’ve got a phenomenally flavorful, herby and aromatic, on-the-go breakfast at the ready. Like any breakfast burrito worth its salt, it pairs wonderfully with all manner of hot sauces and salsas, like our Chunky Garlic & Jalapeño Hot Sauce.

(Think: Frozen Three Cheese Pizzas, Veggie Patties, Fennel Toothpaste…you get the picture.) If you’re looking for a bonafide treat treat, we suggest Trader Joe’s Halloween Gummies.   Made for us by a much-favored gummy producer in France, who’s supplied many of our classic gummy products of the past, Trader Joe’s Halloween Gummies are fruity, fresh—no stale, hard gummies here, folks— and fun. Each .7-ounce pouch contains an assortment of five spooky shapes, made without gelatin and colored with only naturally available products—like black carrot extract and apple, carrot, pumpkin, & blackcurrant concentrates. Toss one in the your neighborhood Jedi-or-ninja-for-a-night’s candy collection. Pack one in your purse for snacking-on-the-go. Sneak one into your significant other’s lunch bag.

All together, this sublimely simple recipe results in super smooth and satisfying salsa that’s great for dipping with chips, mixing into sauces, or spooning over pretty much anything you can think of.   Seriously: try it on homemade nachos, atop a burger, drizzled over a brown rice bowl with seared salmon and roasted broccolini...Guacasalsa will bring a burst of bright, lightly spicy flavor to them all. When it comes to dipping, feel free to think beyond chips, too: we love them with pupusas, crispy empanadas, French fries and tater tots, or our Buffalo Style Chicken Poppers.

coconut-water-076006,Coconut Water," The quality of any coconut beverage is entirely dependent upon the quality of the coconut. Fortunately for folks who go nuts for the stuff (as many of you do), Trader Joe’s Coconut Water is extracted from only the finest of coconuts, grown on coconut farms in Brazil where the reliably warm climate lends itself to a year-round harvest. The coconuts are plucked and drained of their water, then the water—i.e., the Coconut Water—is pasteurized and blended with a bit of vitamin C to help maintain its natural color.   The whole thing is a simple process, really—so when you pluck a carton of Trader Joe’s Coconut Water from our shelves and crack it open, it’s easy to picture yourself sipping the stuff straight from the source. Its potassium content (about 980mg, or 20% of the recommended daily value, per carton) and convenient, grab-and-go- format make it an excellent option for post-workout rehydration. It also adds some subtle, coconutty flavor to smoothies and mixed drinks. And here’s a #ProTip: no matter how you choose to enjoy it, we recommend chilling our shelf-stable-until-open Coconut Water in the fridge and shaking it well before serving. Cheers!

Within a few days of being plucked, the coconuts are drained of their “water,” which is then pasteurized and packaged with less than 1% fructose and ascorbic acid. Fructose is a natural fruit sugar already in coconut. Adding a little more helps balance the brix count (and therefore the flavor), which can vary seasonally. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) helps to maintain the water’s original color. So... when you pluck this shelf-stable box from our grocery shelves and crack it open, you’ll discover 99% juice, with a refreshing and authentic taste!   Chill it and shake it well before enjoying a glass, straight up. You might also try blending it into homemade soups, or fruit smoothies when you want to add real, coconut flavor.

But if you’re pressed for prep time, or just want to get cooking off your to-do list, you can still conjure the coziness of the season and satisfy your squashy desires with the help of Trader Joe’s Butternut Squash and Caramelized Onion Tart.   Like many good things, the base of this circular Tart starts with a flaky, buttery dough. Nestled inside is a creamy, cheesy filling commingled with savory Caramelized Onions that have been seasoned with fragrant sage and a touch of cayenne pepper. The edges of the dough are folded and pleated inward over the filling, leaving the center exposed to highlight the gem-like cubes of earthy Butternut Squash dotted throughout, and then the whole thng is baked to create a golden-brown crust. This rustic, freeform composition gives the Tart a homey, made-from-scratch vibe, but the only work required of you is overseeing a short stint in the oven to reheat and crisp up the crust. Measuring about seven inches in diameter, this Butternut Squash and Caramelized Onion Tart serves four guests (or two hungry ones), and when sliced and served, it’s as at home on a dinner plate with a green salad as it is on a brunch buffet or appetizer platter.

The finished Pies are packed four to a box, each measuring about three inches in diameter, so you can enjoy their sweet, tender, apple-y goodness whenever a craving for pie presents itself—no fork or pie server required. (Think “apple pie cookie” and you’re on the right track.) Alternatively, you could warm a Pie in the microwave or air fryer and serve it alongside a cup of Organic Fair Trade Breakfast Blend Coffee.

For example, while our Trader Joe’s Organic Seedy Crackers are tremendously savory and delightfully hearty, what really sets them apart is their remarkably resonant crunch. What’s our supplier’s secret? Making each Cracker primarily from the kinds of crispy seeds and grains that tend to play a supporting role in other crackers. Starting with a base of organic brown rice, our supplier mixes in organic quinoa, flax, and sesame seeds into each batch, then flavors them with a bit of umami-forward tamari before baking, resulting in one captivatingly crunchy (and gloriously gluten-free!) Cracker.   Excellent as an anytime snack, and an ideal inclusion in school lunches, our vegan and kosher (pareve) Organic Seedy Crackers especially excel when used as a vehicle for cheeses, charcuterie, or dips. We find that their superlatively crisp texture and light umami edge make them particularly suited for pairing with rich, creamy fare.

It also impacts the texture—giving the baked Croissant a softer interior than our non-cocoa enhanced croissants.

organic-red-butter-lettuce-077284,Organic Red Butter Lettuce," So named for its superlatively soft texture and mild, gently sweet flavor profile, Butter Lettuce is one of those leafy greens that makes every salad, sandwich, or anything else its added to feel a little more luxurious. And in the interests of adding even more elegance to your eating experience, we now offer Trader Joe’s Organic Red Butter Lettuce in our produce section. Pre-washed and ready to eat, this light and delicate Lettuce is just as delicious and texturally satisfying as its exclusively-green counterpart, while also exhibiting a glorious gradient of green to rich, purply red in every tender leaf.   In need of a quick side salad with dinner? Our Organic Red Butter Lettuce is a convenient (and cost-effective) choice: simply toss with your favorite salad dressing (we find something creamy like our Organic Italian Dressing pairs particularly well this Lettuce’s super soft bite), a few halved cherry tomatoes, and something crunchy like Candied Pecans or Rosemary Croissant Croutons, and voilà!

cut-napa-cabbage-077326,Cut Napa Cabbage," A certified staple of many East Asian cuisines, you might best know Napa Cabbage for its starring role in kimchi—or, to be more specific, baechu kimchi, the style you’ll find in the Kimchi we carry in our very own refrigerators. A cruciferous cultivar within the same species of brassica that includes bok choy, field mustard, and turnips (who knew?), Napa Cabbage is adored across the globe for its mild, subtly sweet flavor and tender texture. We adore it so much, in fact, that we now carry Napa Cabbage, pre-washed and Cut into ready-to-cook segments, as part of our everyday produce offerings. Cooking with Napa has never been easier!   Try adding Trader Joe’s Cut Napa Cabbage into soups, stews, and stir-fries—we find its flavor profile takes especially well to savory, umami, and spicy seasonings. The more substantial segments can be enjoyed raw as a scoop for dips, while the lighter, leafier cuts make a great base for a salad, or shredded into a slaw and tossed with our Organic Toasted Sesame Dressing. And for a particularly easy entrée, simply sauté a handful with some thinly sliced garlic and a few dashes of our Organic Coconut Aminos, then serve over a plate of Squiggly Knife Cut Style Noodles and your favorite protein.

Made for us by a trusted supplier, who brings in authentic, IGP-designated Aceto Balsamico di Modena to make each batch, this special, seasonal offering is complex, enticingly aromatic, and has a delectably dense consistency. In other words, it’s like a love letter to all things balsamic and black truffle, conveniently contained in one bottle.   So, how best to enjoy Trader Joe’s Truffle Glaze? We recommend applying a light drizzle on your favorite savory staples, like grilled salmon, a slice of Pizza Margherita, a freshy seared steak, or a plate of our Italian Tomato & Burrata Raviolini. It makes an excellent ingredient for a full-flavored salad dressing, especially if the salad it’s being used on contains bitter greens like shaved Belgian Endives, and turns a commonplace caprese into a truffle-y triumph.

garlic-asiago-cheese-dip-077488,Garlic & Asiago Cheese Dip," Where does one even begin to recommend occasions for Trader Joe’s Garlic & Asiago Cheese Dip? Perhaps one starts from the premise that any occasion can be vastly improved by the addition of a superlatively creamy, remarkably cheesy, and deeply, aromatically garlicky appetizer Dip, and goes from there. Even with that in mind, we must say that this particular Dip surpasses all expectation. Made with a base of sour cream, cream cheese, mozzarella, and Asiago, it heats up to a magnificently molten texture after just a few minutes in the microwave (or a smidge longer in your conventional oven), at which point it scoops spectacularly well with tortilla chips, baguette slices, or your favorite fresh veggies.   Available in our refrigerators for a limited time, this phenomenally rich and savory Garlic & Asiago Cheese Dip makes an easy hors d’oeuvres for a dinner party, a sensational snack for when you’ve got a group over to watch the game, and a pitch-perfect pairing with a bottle of crisp white wine during a movie night. We find that its delicately tart tanginess (courtesy of the sour cream and cream cheese) and slightly nutty edge (thanks to the Asiago) make it especially apt for serving with something like our Growers Reserve Sauvingon Blanc, or an easy-drinking blonde ale.

kosher-dill-pickle-spears-076436,Kosher Dill Pickle Spears," You’d be hard-pressed to find a more perfect pairing with a sandwich than a crisp dill pickle. Sure, there have been contenders for the crown over the years, but with all respect to the soups and salads of the world, nothing quite complements a sandwich as well as the briny, herby flavor and juicy, satisfying crunch that only pickles can provide. And Trader Joe’s Kosher Dill Pickle Spears, available now in our refrigerators, are particularly proficient at providing both of those crucial elements. Much of that is owed to the fact that our supplier cold-packs them in a savory, well-seasoned brine, which helps them maintain their delectably crisp structure more than their hot-packed, shelf stable cousins. All that results in a fresher feel, fuller flavor, and even more resounding crunch at lunch.   Speaking of which, we’re especially fond of packing these Dill Pickle Spears along as a side for work and school lunches, where they’ll help cut through richer flavors, refresh the palate, and allow you to enjoy your meal even more. For that reason, we also find that they make a great addition to cheese plates and charcuterie boards. And for any fans of Chicago-style hot dogs, Pickle Spears like these are an essential inclusion.

We like to think that breakfast can also be the most interesting meal of the day. That’s why we love Trader Joe’s Super Nutty Oat Clusters Cereal, a captivatingly crunchy collection of light, crispy flakes; crunchy oat clusters; and three types of nuts - almonds, brazil nuts, and pecans. All in all, this cereal is a sweet combination of those three nuts and four grains - oats, rice, corn, and wheat. Every bite boasts a wide variety of crunchy textures and toasty flavors, plus a lively note of rich toffee, turning any rote, mundane breakfast into something a little more special.  Enjoy Trader Joe’s Super Nutty Oat Clusters in the classic way, poured into a bowl with milk or non-dairy alternative (such as a dairy free beverage like our Non-Dairy Oat Beverage for even more variety).

bbq-seasoned-spatchcocked-chicken-058881,BBQ Seasoned Spatchcocked Chicken," Prepped and ready to cook right away, TJ’s BBQ Seasoned Spatchcocked Chicken comes pre-spatchcocked (that is to say, butterflied and flattened) and marinated in a mix of apple juice, maple syrup, honey, mustard and coffee, along with a tasty blend of peppery BBQ seasonings. Since the Chicken is flattened, and thus has more surface area, it will both cook more quickly, and retain more moisture through the cooking process than your everyday, non-butterflied bird. In other words, this chicken may be flat, but its flavors are anything but.   To prepare, simply remove the BBQ Seasoned Spatchocked Chicken from the bag and place it skin-side up on a pre-heated grill until well-browned and its internal temperature reaches 165°F on a meat thermometer. Or, lay it skin-side up in a shallow baking dish and cook at 375oF for about an hour. (Cooking time varies according to the size of your bird.) That’s it! Serve with some TJ’s Old Fashioned Potato Salad, whip up a TJ’s Organic Coleslaw Kit and heat up some Organic Baked Beans, and you’ve got an easy, complete, classic BBQ dinner for four.

What we would venture to say, however, is that there’s almost never a situation where pickles wouldn’t improve a sandwich or burger. And Trader Joe’s Kosher Dill Pickle Chips, available now in our refrigerators, are particularly suited for such improvement. Much of that is owed to the fact that, after our supplier slices them into perfectly sized, crinkle-cut rounds, they’re cold-packed in a savory, well-seasoned brine, which helps them maintain their delectably crisp structure more than their hot-packed, shelf stable cousins. All that results in a fresher feel, fuller flavor, and an even more satisfying textural elemental for anything they’re added to.   Speaking of which, in addition to topping burgers and sandwiches, these Dill Pickle Chips are awesome for layering on top of avocado toast, homemade foccacia, or, for the particularly adventurous, pizza. Beyond their uses as a topping, they’re also great for mincing and mixing into appetizer dips, pastas, picnic salads, soups, quiches, and deviled eggs. And for a classic pub treat, try battering them, deep frying them until they’re crispy, then serving with Everything and the Elote Greek Style Yogurt Dip.

sun-dried-tomato-basil-chicken-tenders-098648,Sun-Dried Tomato & Basil Chicken Tenders," One of the many reasons we love the pre-marinated options in our fresh meat section is their utter simplicity of preparation. With all the chopping, slicing, and seasoning done for you, all that separates you from a juicy, flavorful, center-of-the-plate protein is a few minutes of grilling, roasting, or sautéeing. Take Trader Joe’s Sun- Dried Tomato & Basil Chicken Tenders, which are making their grand comeback to our refrigerators, for instance. Made with a base of boneless, skinless Chicken Breast tenders and a creamy, savory, Mediterranean- style marinade, prepping this dish from scratch would normally be a labor-intensive endeavor. But since all the work is done for you, you’re free to focus on the finer details, like what kind of side to serve alongside them—or what kind of wine...   Speaking of which, we find the tart and tangy notes of the Sun-Dried Tomato, along with the bright aromatics of the Basil, garlic, and onion make this is an ideal protein to pair with pasta, roasted veggies, and a dry, yet fruity, red wine. For something a little different, try pan-frying these Tenders and placing them in a sandwich with Pesto and slices of Fresh Mozzarella.

savory-herbed-chicken-thighs-059461,Savory Herbed Chicken Thighs," Among the common cuts of meat, chicken thighs might just make the most compelling canvas for seasonings, sauces, and marinades. Since chicken thighs have a relatively higher fat content, they’re typically more juicy and flavorful from the start, which tends to create all the more exciting interactions with other flavors. Case in point: Trader Joe’s Savory Herbed Chicken Thighs. Each package contains boneless, skinless cuts of Chicken Thigh that have been seasoned with a sublimely savory marinade that’s made with aromatic herbs like basil, cilantro, and mint, along with garlic, shredded lemon peel, crushed chili peppers, and even a bit of fish sauce for an extra umami kick.   This mix of bold herbs, seasonings, and aromatics, combined with the natural juiciness and richness of the Chicken Thighs, creates a uniquely delicious flavor profile once they’re fully cooked. Speaking of which, since they’re pre-marinated and ready to go, cooking is a breeze: simply grill, roast, or pan-fry until a thermometer in their internal temperature reads 165°F on a meat thermometer. After that, it’s simply a matter of picking a side to serve them with: we like them with a bit of Organic Cauliflower Rice, some steamed veggies, or a fully-loaded baked potato, ourselves.

If you ask us, it comes down to a very simple aspect of our salad-selecting philosophy: we only bring in the kinds of salads that we would want to eat on our lunch breaks, too. Trader Joe’s Sesame Miso Salad with Salmon is a prime example of this philosophy in action. Inspired by the kinds of salmon-topped entrée salads you might find at a higher-end restaurant, each one starts with a blend of crisp, leafy greens like romaine, frisée, and baby spinach, to which our supplier adds shredded red cabbage and carrots, diced cucumbers, sliced green onions, and well-seasoned, flaky, grilled salmon. They also include a packet of crispy-fried onion pieces for a pop of texture, and a super flavorful sesame miso dressing to tie it all together.   Once tossed, this Sesame Miso Salad wth Salmon offers a captivating complex mix of textures and flavors, from the light, leafy elegance of the spring mix, to the tender richness of the salmon, and especially in the combination of umami, spice, and sweetness in the dressing. An excellent option for an easy lunch or dinner, we recommend enjoying this Salad with something sweet and fizzy, like a Sparkling Green Tea with Pineapple Juice Beverage.

organic-coconut-milk-055238,Organic Coconut Milk," When we set out to carry a coconut milk, we had three main goals: One, we wanted a coconut milk that can be certified organic. Two, we wanted a product that has no gums added to it. Three, of course, we wanted a milk that tastes great. Trader Joe’s Organic Coconut Milk scores on all three counts!   Our Sri Lankan supplier starts with organically-grown King Coconut. As true “coconut scientists,” these experts know how to press shredded coconut meat at different stages and blend the resulting milks to create the exact flavor profile we are looking for. It’s a clean coconutty flavor, with a mild coconut aroma. The texture is smooth and milky—not to too thick or too thin. Amazingly, they’ve achieved this texture without the use of thickeners or gums—additives that are present in most of the other coconut milk brands you’ll find in the marketplace. The only thing added to our Coconut Milk is a small amount of filtered water that helps to balance the fat content.   Cook with it—our Organic Coconut Milk is excellent in curries. Or, drink it—it is fantastic in smoothies, as a substitute for dairy in tea and coffee, or straight from the can (though we recommend pouring it into a nice smooth-rimmed drinking glass first).

chocolate-hazelnut-ground-coffee-075079,Chocolate Hazelnut Ground Coffee," If you’re a fan of flavored coffee, you know that not all flavored coffees are created equal. Thankfully, the only flavored coffees you’ll find at your neighborhood Trader Joe’s are those that have been evaluated to meet our exacting standards for a cup of joe—flavored or not—and then naturally flavored in a way that highlights the carefully selected base blend of beans. It’s with this in mind that we’re thrilled to introduce Trader Joe’s Chocolate Hazelnut Ground Coffee to our everyday coffee offerings.   Our supplier sources 100% Arabica beans from Cerrado de Minas, one of the most renowned coffee growing regions in Brazil. The small bean size from this region produces a full-bodied, mildly flavored brew with a creamy mouthfeel; once the beans are given a light roast and ground, they provide the ideal backdrop for the infusion of a natural flavor oil imbued with fragrant notes of rich Chocolate and toasted Hazelnut. The result is a delightfully smooth sipping experience with every cup, whether you’re in the mood for a welcoming wakeup or warming treat on a chilly afternoon. Sip it straight to let the flavors shine, or add a splash of creamer to further enhance the Coffee’s inherent sweetness and velvety mouthfeel.

brined-bone-in-chicken-breast-072044,Brined Bone-In Chicken Breast," Trader Joe’s Brined Bone-In Chicken Breast is about three things: high-quality poultry, convenience, and great flavor!   First, the Chicken Breast in this package is All Natural—which officially means that it’s minimally processed, with no artificial ingredients. And the chickens were raised on all-vegetarian feed, with no antibiotics ever, and no added hormones. Second, we’ve gone ahead and Brined the Breast for you, with a seasoning mix that includes salt, sugar, white pepper, and garlic & onion powders. Aside from the flavor benefits of this marinade, brining helps keep the meat moist and tender through the cooking process. Using salt to keep moisture in might seem a little counter-intuitive, but there’s some real science to it: Typically, as proteins cook, the muscle fibers shrink, which squeezes out moisture. Salt slows down this squeezing process, allowing muscle fibers to absorb the moisture instead, creating juicier, more flavorful results.   And speaking of flavor, since these Breasts are Bone-In, they retain even more moisture while cooking, which complements all the taste-benefits the brining brings. Consequently, they need only minimal seasoning, if any, prior to cooking. We recommend just a light sprinkling of your favorite seasoning blend, or a brush of your favorite TJ’s BBQ sauce before grilling or roasting.

Trader Joe’s Brigadeiros are made for us in Portugal, where they’re also a treasured confection. Our authentic recipe includes sweetened condensed milk, cream, cocoa, and cultured butter. This combination creates a rich, dense, chocolatey ball of fudge. Each soft sphere is rolled in real chocolate sprinkles, providing a pleasant textural contrast—not to mention more chocolate flavor. But you may ask: why the name?   Brigadeiros were first popularized during the Brazilian presidential election of 1945, when Brazilian women (who just recently had gained the right to vote), made mounds & mounds of these bonbons and sold them in support of their candidate, Brigadier Eduardo Gomes. While Gomes lost the election, one might say that the rest of the country still won, as the popularity of “brigadier’s candy” proliferated.

Maybe that’s the kind of salsa you’re thinking of when you hear about our Fall Harvest Salsa—you’re probably thinking: tomatoes, onions, jalapeños; diced and mixed, ready for chip dipping.   You’d only be partly right! Take your North American idea of salsa and move it north and east, to New England. Now flip the calendar forward to autumn. Remove those tomatoes and replace them with fire-roasted tomatillos. Add in some honey-roasted, heirloom Dickinson pumpkin chunks, and diced butternut squash. Balance those slightly spicy jalapeños with some chopped sweet apples, and pull it all together with honey, vinegar, and lime. We call this the “salsification of New England… with a Latin twist.”   Our Fall Harvest Salsa melds fantastic fall flavors with the brightness and heat you expect from a typical salsa.

spatchcocked-sweet-savory-chicken-075150,Spatchcocked Sweet & Savory Chicken," Likely derived from a combination of the 16th century Irish term “spitchcock” (the practice of splitting an eel down the middle before roasting or frying it) and a punny reference to “dispatching the cock” (i.e., cooking a chicken rather quickly), we find that saying the word “spatchcock” is a lot more fun than the actual act of spatchcocking a chicken, itself.

And since each Chicken comes pre-Spatchcocked (which is to say, split open at the breastbone and flattened), even the cooking process is much simpler, too. Just place it skin side up in a shallow baking pan and roast at 350°F for 45-50 minutes for a perfectly evenly cooked, beautifully browned bird. Once cooked, the sweet and savory seasoning will caramelize wonderfully, making it a phenomenally flavorful center-of-the-plate option.

They’re simple vanilla wafer cookies sandwiched together with pumpkin crème filling. That filling is delightfully pumpkin-y, sweet but not too sweet, and oh-so creamy. While we may sound casual about this combination, achieving the Pumpkin Joe-Joe was a tough task, albeit also a tasty one. In fact, we tested 17 different versions to find the ideal tension between cookie and fill- ing and the perfect harmony of pumpkin, vanilla and warm spice flavor. Totally worth it.   Like all of the cookies in this family, the Pumpkin Joe-Joe’s are twistable, dunkable, crunchable, crumbleable, and eminently enjoyable. Unlike most of the others, these are only available for a very short period of time.

double-fold-bourbon-vanilla-extract-076665,Double Fold Bourbon Vanilla Extract," All too often, “vanilla” is considered the default flavor—the boring, mundane choice at the ice cream parlor. In reality, vanilla is a rapturously rich and utterly unique flavor. Sweet, warm, and enchantingly floral, there’s a reason that vanilla is such a ubiquitous inclusion in baked goods and sweet treats—it’s simply very good at making desserts, and even savory dishes, taste better. That’s why, starting now through the end of the holiday season, we’re proud to offer Trader Joe’s Double Fold Vanilla Extract. Using Madagascar-grown vanilla beans (which, like all natural vanilla, are actually the seed pods of a tropical orchid ), our supplier makes each batch with twice the amount of vanilla as a standard strength extract (hence, Double Fold.) They then further fortify it with Vanilla Bean Seeds, resulting in a pleasantly potent Vanilla Extract that provides an impressive pop of vanilla flavor to cakes, pies, cookies, sauces, cocktails, and everything in between.   With its elegantly-styled, long-necked bottle and charming cork stopper, Trader Joe’s Double Fold Vanilla Extract with Vanilla Bean Seeds is an apt and attractive addition to any pantry, and makes an ideal gift for home bakers of all experience levels. Perhaps some stores would be content enough with these estimable aesthetic and culinary qualities, but since this is Trader Joe’s, we’ve gone the additional step of making its value exceptional, too: while supplies last, you can pick up of a bottle of our Double Fold Vanilla Extract for a fraction of the price you’d pay for extracts of similar quality elsewhere.

dominican-republic-jarabacoa-small-lot-coffee-075146,Dominican Republic Jarabacoa Small Lot Coffee," Jarabacoa, located in the central region of the Dominican Republic, is home to third-generation coffee farmers who are dedicated to the cultivation of high-quality coffee beans. For this small-lot selection, these farmers harvest 100% Arabica coffee cherries, then refine their skins and pulp. Normally, the sticky-sweet outer layer of the coffee fruit is washed off, but these beans are “honey processed,” so that layer is left intact. Because they spend less time in water, the sun-dried beans ferment less and retain more natural sweetness.   Trader Joe’s Dominican Republic Jarabacoa Small Lot Coffee wears its honey process on its sip. Immediately, a taster can detect a subtle sweetness, accompanied by notes of chocolate and hints of blackberry. The honeyed profile pairs wonderfully with sweet breakfast pastries, like Trader Joe’s Pumpkin Ginger Scones. Sip it in the afternoon with a dunk of an Apple Cider Donut, or enjoy it after dinner, affogato style, with a scoop of Trader Joe’s Salted Maple Ice Cream.

These Danish-style pastries are made for us by (appropriately enough) a bakery partner in Denmark, who crafts each Bun by twisting sweet, cinnamon-apple-compote-filled dough into a quick knot, topping it with a light, streusel-like crumb, then baking it until it’s gloriously golden brown. It’s enough to make anyone aspire to morning person-hood.   While our Apple Cinnamon Buns can be enjoyed at room temperature, right out of the box, we find they reach new heights of texture, aroma, and flavor when lightly toasted just before serving. Similarly, while they can be eaten solo, they’re especially delectable when served with a nice cup of tea or coffee, like our Organic Fair Trade Breakfast Blend.

vegetable-tray-077630,Vegetable Tray," You’ll find a basic veggie tray in pretty much any supermarket or big box club store. They’re generally... fine. When we contemplated bringing something similar into Trader Joe’s, our goal was never... fine. Our goal was... excellent, and, at the risk of hubris, we think we’ve achieved our goal, in the form of the creatively named Trader Joe’s Vegetable Tray.   A good Vegetable Tray needs good vegetables, and here we deliver the goods, with festively colorful rainbow carrots, crunchy celery bites, crisp crinkle cut radishes, vividly-green broccoli florets, and snappy snap peas. If you find yourself musing that this isn’t a mix of veg you’ve seen in other commercially-available trays, your musings are correct. We spent a good deal of time discussing which vegetables we most like to encounter on a party platter, and we worked with our supplier to get precisely those veggies. Only the good stuff.   Speaking of good stuff, you’ll notice this Tray is all veg, no dip. We took one look at the dips in our refrigerated case and thought, “Let’s give our customers the opporutnity to decide which dips will delight their guests.” Whether it’s hummus, salsa, a creamy dip, a spicy something – or all of the above! – you’re sure to find the ideal dip to go along with these ideal veggies.

Since we’re in prime pumpkin season, we figure it’s as good a time as any to expound on the excellence of Trader Joe’s Cut Butternut Squash. When you begin with a whole squash at home, you have your work cut out for you. Peeling, chopping, seeding, cleaning… there’s a good amount of effort involved in making Butternuts “recipe ready.” Our Cut Butternut, on the other hand, is peeled, seeded, and cut into evenly sized cubes, making it “recipe-ready” for almost any fall-forward cooking endeavor. Roast, steam, or even cook in the microwave. Purée them, mash them, add them to a casserole. Create sides, soups, and baked goods. The uses for our Cut Butternut Squash are plentiful, as will be your free time when you add this veggie to your repertoire.

For while it does contain pumpkin, it does in fact resemble whipped marshmallow, it’s vegan, its scent is reminiscent of pumpkin pie, and it is called butter, it’s not the kind of butter you slather on toast. Rather, it’s the kind of butter you slather on yourself – your skin, to be specific.   Pumpkin Body Butter is a thick, rich, moisturizing cream made just for Trader Joe’s. It was developed with high quality ingredients that nourish and replenish the skin, notably coconut oil, shea butter, and pumpkin seed oil. It’s free of parabens and phthalates. We recommend Pumpkin Body Butter for use on very dry skin; its skin-healing effects are immediate, and it absorbs into your skin quickly without leaving an oily residue.

It has long been an ingredient in Eastern and Central European cuisines, making its way to the U.S. and U.K. through westward immigration in the 19th and 20th centuries. It has since been kept on hand to tame picante Tex-Mex dishes, as well as make quick dips and silky sauces. With a pure and simple ingredient list, Trader Joe’s Sour Cream delivers the freshest pasteurized cream, milk, corn starch, and live and active cultures ready for you to use on your culinary adventures!

The evaporation process produces perfect sugar crystals, golden in color and rich in natural molasses flavor.   In this natural state, Sugar is sweeter and more flavorful than processed, refined, white sugar. And as baking season really gets underway, just think about how delicious your baked goods will taste when you use Trader Joe’s Organic Sugar in place of the “white stuff.” Use Trader Joe’s Organic Cane Sugar in all things baked, ice creams, and candies.

That’s where Trader Joe’s Lactose Free Cream Cheese comes in. Made with lactase, the enzyme that naturally breaks down lactose, it has all the same delicately tart flavor and superb spreadability you’d expect from a Cream Cheese, and absolutely none of the lactose.   Just like its lactose-containing cousins, Trader Joe’s Lactose Free Cream Cheese can be used in a plethora of rich, delicious recipes, from fantastically full-flavored appetizer dips to consummately creamy chowders, to sweet and fluffy frostings for carrot cake, brownies, or homemade whoopie pies. It adds body and a nice depth of flavor when mixed into a baked macaroni and cheese or casserole, it makes for a marvelous Lactose Free cheesecake, and a spoonful will even elevate a simple pan of scrambled eggs.

shrimp-garlic-flatbread-075067,Shrimp & Garlic Flatbread," Maybe it’s chemistry, maybe it’s biology, maybe it’s some grand, unfathomable cosmic connection, but there’s just something about the combination of shrimp, garlic, and a creamy sauce that makes it seem as though all three were made for one another. Time and time again, in curries, pastas, and chowders, these three powerhouses of flavor form something even greater than the already-formidable sum of their parts. And now, in Trader Joe’s Shrimp & Garlic Flatbread, this tremendous trio takes their talents in a crisp, cheesy, decidedly pizza-esque direction.   Each Flatbread starts with a light and thin rectangular crust, to which our supplier adds a rich, garlic-butter béchamel sauce that’s been seasoned with white pepper and curry powder, aromatic herbs like chives and parsley, as well as orange and lemon zest for a bit of balancing acidity. Next, they add savory and slightly umami-tinged grated Parmesan, and de-shelled, tail-off Shrimp to complete the picture. Once cooked in your home oven (18-20 minutes at 475°F, from frozen, ought to do the trick) this Flatbread makes an easy and delicious appetizer or entrée: we recommend pairing it with an Organic Caesar Salad to make it a complete meal, and a glass of crisp white wine to make the most of its classic creamy garlic & shrimp combo.

They’re made with super premium, food-grade, platinum silicone, which in addition to being the highest quality of silicone available in the U.S., is definitely the silicone with the coolest name available in the U.S. They’re microwave, freezer, and dishwasher safe, and each package contains three bags, each in one of three different sizes: small, which can hold up to 8.45 fluid ounces in volume (enough to hold a couple servings of trail mix), medium, which can hold up to 23.67 fluid ounces (enough to hold a well-stacked sandwich) and large, which holds up to 33.81 fluid ounces (enough to hold roughly 3-4 slices of pizza).   Super functional (and, if you ask us, rather fashionable), these Reusable Bags improve on their single-use counterparts in practically every way: they’re super durable, they zip open and closed like a dream, and they even stand up on their own for ease of filling. In short, they’re great for storing everything from leftovers to pre-prepped ingredients, school lunches, and afternoon snacks.

mango-blueberry-chia-bowl-075233,Mango Blueberry Chia Bowl," Starting your morning with a bowl of fruit is a sure-fire way to make your day that much brighter (and sweeter, and tangier—depending on the fruit, of course). That’s why we’re such big fans of Trader Joe’s Mango Blueberry Chia Bowl. Made with an ingredient deck that’s exclusively fruit, fruit juice, chia seeds, and water, each bowl starts with a base of tangy mango purée that’s been mixed with coconut cream, passion fruit juice, and black chia seeds. Together, the sweet and tropical notes of the mango and passionfruit play perfectly off of the plush silkiness of the coconut cream and satisfying chewiness of the chia seeds. And when you combine that with the clean and simple flavors of the included whole blueberries and diced mango, you’ve got one magnificent morning on your hands.   And since all the puréeing, chopping, and mixing has been done for you already, all you need to do to enjoy our frozen Mango Blueberry Chia Bowl is to let it thaw—either overnight in the fridge, for about an hour and a half at room temperature, or by heating in the microwave for a little more than a minute. It makes an excellent (not to mention effortless) weekday breakfast option, especially when topped with something crunchy, like chopped nuts, a full-flavored granola, or our very own Organic Unsweetened Coconut Chips.

But what if you like to drink your pumpkin? At Trader Joe’s, you can do that, too! The Gourd Tree Pumpkin Cider is one of several drinkable options. Here’s the story...   After being disappointed by other pumpkin ciders on the market—with their predominant apple flavor and spices verging on potpourri—we approached one of the breweries with whom we’ve partnered quite a bit to help us develop a superior version. Initial results were disappointing... until we added actual pumpkin and squash purée! The Gourd Tree Pumpkin Cider is 22% pumpkin & squash purée, added to the base of fermented, not-from-concentrate apple juice from Oregon. (While we’re on percentages, this Cider is 5% ABV—conveniently session-able for this season of get-togethers.)

We like the story that it comes from a combination of the Mayan words pop (“sphere”), and utz (“good”). Aside from a visit to your local pupuseria, Trader Joe’s Chicken, Cheese & Green Chile Pupusas are a convenient and delicious way to satisfy all your “good-sphere” cravings!   Pupusas begin as a ball of corn-flour dough that is flattened and stuffed with meat and cheese, then rolled back up into a sphere before being gently flattened once again to form a sort of savory, stuffed pancake. Our Pupusas are filled with chicken breast & thigh meat, shredded mozzarella cheese, and roasted Hatch chiles. These simple flavors—tender savory chicken, smooth melty cheese, and mildly smoky chili-peppers—combine to create a delicious and comforting handheld snack.   We recommend you heat Trader Joe’s Chicken, Cheese & Green Chile Pupusas from frozen in a skillet with a bit of oil, cooking for 5 or so minutes per side until golden brown and heated through. Then you can dip them in your favorite TJ’s salsa, like our Hatch Valley Salsa for added Hatch flavor, or our mild Pico de Gallo. If you have the gumption and the time, you can combine TJ’s Shredded Green Cabbage with onion, jalapeńo, salt, and apple cider vinegar to make your own curtido (fermented cabbage relish), which is a very traditional, and very tasty pupusa condiment.

josephsbrau-oktoberfest-175193,Josephsbrau Oktoberfest," Josephsbrau Oktoberfest is a rich, complexly malted lager, made exclusively for us by a respected West Coast craft brewer who marries modern-day technology with old-world recipes. In this particular case, that “marriage” takes some inspiration from a real-life historical wedding! First celebrated in Munich in 1810, the inaugural Oktoberfest was thrown to mark the nuptials of Kronprinz Ludwig to Princess Therese of Saxe- Hildburghausen. Now nearly synomous with beer, Josephsbrau Oktoberfest is an homage to the festival’s official drink, known to locals as Märzenbier. In fact, in order to match Märzenbier’s marvelously malty profile, the brewers at Josephsbrau have imported three kinds of malts all the way from Germany!   Each sip of Josephsbrau Oktoberfest is full-bodied and caramel-y, but with a light enough touch of hops that it remains remarkably easy-drinking. We recommend serving it well chilled, out of the can or in a frosty glass (or stein, if you’ve got one!), preferably alongside a grilled steak, sausage, or burger. We find that its toasty caramel malts are particularly suited to pairing with seared, and even slightly charred proteins—try a can the next time you’ve got chicken wings, ribs, or brats on the barbecue.

Just when you think the flavor has fully revealed itself, you discover a subtle hint of citrus at the finish that really pleases the palate.

The resultant sauce is medium- thick with robust tomato flavor, accented by a bit of nuttiness from the Parmesan and a finishing flourish of basil. Your pasta will be psyched to meet this Sauce.

Unlike some “pumpkin flavored” cereals you may find in other stores, these are made with actual pumpkin—the real deal!   A bit of cinnamon hints at pumpkin pie, so you may be tempted to top these with whipped cream. That would likely be beyond delicious. We think, though, that cold milk is the best partner for these O’s, for breakfast, lunch, or even dinner.

grilled-pitted-green-olives-074465,Grilled Pitted Green Olives," Olives truly are one of the most fascinating fruits on the planet. Depending on the variety, they can have a near endlessly wide variety of flavors, ranging from peppery to nutty, grassy to tart, and everything in between. Some varieties, like Chalkidiki olives from Greece, have a buttery, savory flavor and firm texture that some describe as “meaty.” Here’s where things get really fascinating: as it turns out, one of the best ways to bring olives with that flavor/texture combo to their fullest expression is to grill them, more or less like you would meat on a skewer. And that’s precisely what’s been done to Trader Joe’s Grilled Pitted Green Olives.   They’re made for us by a supplier in Greece, who grows their own Chalkidiki olives in groves right by their packing facilities. After curing the Olives, they pit them, then place them on a hot grill until distinct, lined sear marks develop. These sear marks not only provide a nice bit of texture to each olive, but develop a deep, warm, Maillard reaction-based savoriness, too. A fascinating preparation for an already fascinating fruit, Trader Joe’s Grilled Pitted Green Olives are superb as a standalone snack, a great option for garnishing salads, sandwiches, and savory cocktails, and a smart choice for cheese platters, antipasto plates, and charcuterie boards.

gluten-free-cinnamon-raisin-bread-055476,Gluten Free Cinnamon Raisin Bread," As a snack, a simple slice of Cinnamon Raisin Bread approaches perfection.

We want all our customers to have the Cinnamon Raisin Bread experience, and that’s why we’re bringing Trader Joe’s Gluten Free Cinnamon Raisin Bread back to our bakery shelves. Reformulated with a new recipe that no longer includes eggs (which means it’s now also vegan!), this hearty loaf smells and tastes just like classic Cinnamon Raisin Bread—because it is! All we’ve done is replaced the wheat flour with a combination of brown rice flour and tapioca flour. Husked brown rice is finely ground and used as the primary substitute for wheat flour. The tapioca flour—derived from the root of the cassava plant from South America—helps provide some of the crispness and chew that’s often missing in other gluten free breads.   This bread is great for breakfast, toasted with a spread of butter (or a bit of Trader Joe’s Vegan Buttery Spread, to keep it totally vegan).

broccoli-cheddar-cheese-quiche-010142,Broccoli & Cheddar Cheese Quiche," Quiche tends to have a reputation for being a highfalutin, complicated piece of haute cuisine among the general public, but its formulation is actually quite simple: a rich, buttery crust filled with fluffy eggs, and other tasty fillings. We’ve always thought that this simple, savory-pie construction is one of its greatest strengths. Trader Joe’s Broccoli & Cheddar Cheese Quiche definitely plays to this strength—but don’t think for a minute that “simple construction” means anything less than delicious!   This one begins with a flaky, wheat-flour crust, shaped like a fluted pie shell. Inside that shell is a fluffy mixture of eggs, with both mild & sharp Cheddar cheeses, plus pieces of Broccoli. Savory (and simple) seasonings support these flavors, including onions, garlic, salt & black pepper.   Keeping with the theme, it couldn’t be much simpler to prepare this Broccoli & Cheddar Cheese Quiche. Cook it from frozen for 3 minutes in your microwave, or 20-25 minutes in your 400°F conventional oven. Let it rest for 1-2 minutes, and your Quiche is hot (and haute!) and ready to enjoy. It’s the ideal size for an individual breakfast. Or slice it in half and pair with Trader Joe’s Fully Cooked Uncured Bacon, and A Fruitful Medley for a fast and delicious brunch for two!

chocolate-vanilla-creme-joe-joes-076572,Chocolate Vanilla Creme Joe-Joe's," While our buyers are always on the lookout for the Next Big ThingTJ in the cookie department, there’s something about a classic recipe, crafted to our stringent cookie standards (among them, delightfulness, deliciousness, and of course, dunkability) that’s, quite frankly, irresistible. Case (or cookie, rather) in point: our new and improved Trader Joe’s Joe-Joe’s Chocolate Vanilla Creme Sandwich Cookies.   In recent memory, the classic Joe-Joe’s we all knew and loved simply weren’t matching our expectations. So we partnered with a long-time supplier to create a next-generation Joe-Joe worthy of the name. It starts simply enough with two delightfully crunchy, chocolate cookies, made with rich cocoa powder and a touch of sea salt. Sandwiched between them is a sweet, whipped creme filling, flecked with fragrant, flavorful specks of vanilla bean throughout. It’s a timeless—and undeniably delicious—combination of toothsome cookies and velvety creme, ideal for dunking in milk, snacking out of hand, packing in a lunch bag, crumbling into the base of an ice cream cake... you get the idea!   In addition to the glow-up of the Cookies themselves, we’ve taken this opportunity to remove the outer box from the equation, opting instead for a resealable film that protects the cookies in their tray while simultaneously maximizing freshness—no cookie jar required! Whether you’re a fan of the original or an inquisitive initiate, Joe-Joe’s Chocolate Vanilla Creme Sandwich Cookies are sure to become an instant classic in your pantry.

waffle-weave-cotton-kitchen-towels-075425,Waffle Weave Cotton Kitchen Towels," Japanese in its origin, kaizen is a philosophy of continuous improvement—ongoing change for the better. At Trader Joe’s, it’s through our commitment to Kaizen that we make our store and our products the best they can be for our customers. To that end, when our Tunisian supplier presented us with an opportunity to kaizen our Cotton Kitchen Towels, we leapt at the chance… and Trader Joe’s Waffle Weave Cotton Kitchen Towels were born.   Carefully woven on large looms, our new 100% Cotton Kitchen Towels take absorbency to a new level. The secret? Why, it’s in the Waffle Weave! The tiny, recessed squares inherent in a Waffle Weave make for an increase in the fabric’s surface area, and an increase in the fabric’s surface area makes for an increase in its dish- drying, spill-sopping, counter-cleaning capabilities.

Well, to that, we say: that’s not never stopped us from trying before! Made for us by a supplier in Italy, Trader Joe’s Pretzel Breadsticks takes the basic form of a breadstick (the kind you might find as an appetizer at a cloth napkin Italian restaurant, rather than the softer kind you might get at a pizzeria) and properly pretzel-izes it. Each stick starts as a bit of rustic, sourdough-esque dough, which is rolled into a twisty, approximately eight- inch-long baton, then baked to a perfect golden brown before being studded with cruncht crystals of sea salt.   Much like their combined, namesake inspirations, Trader Joe’s Pretzel Breadsticks make a fantastic appetizer or anytime snack, all on their own. Where we think they really excel, however, is in their use as a dipping and dunking snack. We recommend trying them in everything from spicy mustards and tart, tangy aiolis (like our very own Aioli Garlic Mustard Sauce to bubbly fondues and savory-seasoned dips of all kinds, like our Crunchy Chili Onion Hummus, Creamy Spinach & Artichoke Dip, or Pimento Cheese Dip.

Our latest mashup benefits from two beloved French traditions...   Perhaps you’ve enjoyed palmiers? The traditional version involves puff pastry that is rolled flat, coated with sugar, then rolled back up from both sides and cut on the bias to produce cookie-like pastries resembling palm tree leaves (or hearts—depending on your POV). Once baked, palmiers are flaky, sweet treats.   Working with a French producer, our developers started with this palmier concept, then added another French tradition: Onion Confit. For our Swirls, onions are cooked low & slow with balsamic vinegar, sugar, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. This caramelized, almost jam-like mixture is rolled into a puff pastry, along with some Emmental cheese. Once cut and baked, the resulting mini crackers have that palmier texture, with the alluring flavor & aroma of savory-sweet onions—plus a hint of Swiss... If French onion soup were a flaky pastry, it would aspire to be Trader Joe’s Onion Confit Swirls!

sourdough-sandwich-bread-051986,Sourdough Sandwich Bread," Toast sounds simple, and in a way, it is simple. But, when you consider that the source of good toast is really good bread, it suddenly sounds not so simple after all. After testing a wide variety of contenders, we’ve come to the unanimous decision that the very best bread for toast-making is sourdough. And because toast requires slices of bread, our conclusion also included the rationale that sliced Sourdough is the most practical Sourdough for this particular endeavor. And thus, Trader Joe’s Sourdough Sandwich Bread tops our list of “Best Breads for Toast” for this and every year.   Our Sourdough Sandwich Bread is made exclusively for us, and will be slightly different depending on where in Trader Joe’s country you pick up your loaf – the flavor of Sourdough depends largely on the “starter,” which is a living culture that lends the bread its signature sour profile. Because every starter is different, every bakery produces a slightly different flavor profile. What they all have in common is their excellence – especially when toasted. So slather on some butter, a bit of jam, or make a PB&J on Sourdough toast. You may even take that toasting to a higher level, and make a scrumptious grilled cheese... on Sourdough. Toast away. You’ll be glad you did.

But there’s another yeast, of arguably equal importance, of which you may not be aware.   Trader Joe’s Nutritional Yeast is produced by culturing active yeast with glucose (often beet molasses or sugarcane) for several days. The yeast is deactivated with heat, fortified with B vitamins, dried and packaged. The process results in golden flakes that provide 3 grams of protein and just 10 milligrams of sodium per 1 tablespoon serving. Vegan, gluten free and Kosher (pareve), it’s ready to be used as a savory condiment or key ingredient in all manner of dishes.   Thanks to the hit of cheesy umami flavor it provides, Nutritional Yeast is as versatile as it is tasty. Sprinkle it atop roasted broccoli, baked potatoes or popcorn. Toss with fresh kale leaves & olive oil and roast to make kale chips. Use it in place of dairy or meat-based broths to add richness to soups, stews, gravies—even oatmeal!

sri-lankan-organic-mango-chutney-075255,Sri Lankan Organic Mango Chutney," As a category of condiment, chutney (derived from the Hindi chatni) has a history reaching back to around 500 BCE.

It’s the last of these that serves as the inspiration for Trader Joe’s Sri Lankan Organic Mango Chutney, a simultaneously sweet, savory, and spicy spread that brings a captivatingly complex hit of flavor to everything from curries and charcuterie boards, to sandwiches and samosas, to roti wraps and roasted meats.   Made for us by a supplier in Sri Lanka, this magnificently Mango-forward Chutney is made with a thick, yet smooth and spreadable base of organic cane sugar and organic coconut sap vinegar, to which our supplier adds big, toothsome chunks of organic mango.

kimbap-076023,Kimbap," Known in Korea as gimbap, from gim for “seaweed” and bap for “cooked rice,” kimbap is similar to—but decidedly distinct from—a mega-sized maki sushi roll.

Trader Joe’s Kimbap, for example, takes a veggie-forward approach. Our supplier, a kimbap expert in the Republic of Korea, arranges an assortment of sauteed greens, crunchy root vegetables, and crisp pickles around a base of braised tofu, wraps it all in a layer of rice and seaweed, then slices it into two-or-three-bite-sized rounds.   When viewed in cross section, our conveniently quick-cooking Kimbap resembles a marvelous, multi-flavored mosaic. After cooking from frozen for a mere two minutes in the microwave, it can be enjoyed hot or chilled, served as an entrée, side, or snack. While it’s flavorful enough to hold its own as a dish, it also accessorizes well with a bit of Sriracha, Gochujang Sauce, or Reduced Sodium Soy Sauce.

freeze-dried-fig-slices-073917,Freeze Dried Fig Slices," Freeze dried fruit is a little miracle of modern food technology.

The result is dry and crisp, with concentrated fruit flavors.   Trader Joe’s Freeze Dried Fig Slices come to us directly from a supplier in Turkey, the world’s leading fig-producing country. They use the Smyrna variety of fig, known for its seedy, pink flesh and pale green skin. (Fun fact: when this fig variety was initially transported to California for production, its name was changed: Calimyrna figs are the same as Smyrna figs, but grown in California rather than Turkey.) Here, that pink, seedy interior takes on a crispy texture, and delivers the expected figgy flavors with aplomb.

point-reyes-tomaprovence-artisan-cheese-076420,Point Reyes TomaProvence Artisan Cheese," Situated on the very tip of the westernmost peninsula in Marin County, CA, the idyllic rolling hills of Point Reyes host some of the finest dairy farms in the world. One such dairy farm, the Point Reyes Farmstead Cheese Company, has been family-owned and operated for over 50 years, crafting blues, cheddars, mozzarellas, and, of course, their signature cheese, the Point Reyes Toma. Italian for “wheel of cheese made personally by the farmer”, Point Reyes’s award-winning (and TJ’s Spotlight Cheese alum) Toma has proven so popular, that Point Reyes has recently taken to offering variations on the Toma theme—including our newest Spotlight Cheese, the auspiciously herby Point Reyes TomaProvence.   Made with the same base as their celebrated Toma and TomaTruffle (another former Spotlight fave) Point Reyes TomaProvence sets itself apart via the inclusion of a mix of aromatic herbs de provence, including rosemary, basil, savory, thyme, and marjoram. The resulting cheese is rich and herbaceous, with the same easy-eating, sem-firm texture that made us fall in love with the original Toma. Try it as part of a charcuterie board with olives, Marinated Artichokes, and Uncured Salame de Parma. Enjoy it sliced or shredded in a grilled cheese, patty melt, or omelet. Or, simply enjoy it as a solitary, anytime snacking cheese, with or without a chilled glass of buttery Chardonnay.

fromage-pave-red-chili-pepper-074644,Fromage Pavé Red Chili Pepper," Like its famed forebearer, Fromage Pavé, Trader Joe’s Red Chili Pepper Fromage Pavé is a square, soft-ripened French cheese made from milk that undergoes an ultrafiltration process, ostensibly removing the whey from the milk before the cheesemaking process begins. As a result, the cheese ripens faster—you get a 60% butterfat, double crème Fromage that’s ready to enjoy after just two weeks of aging.   What sets this Pavé apart is its tongue-tingling triumvirate of jalapeño, cayenne, and red bell peppers. Together, they lend a fiery kick of heat and a splash of color to the cheese’s mild and buttery base. If you’re a fan of soft-ripened cheeses and all things spicy, Trader Joe’s Red Chili Pepper Fromage Pavé belongs on your list... and your cheese board. Serve alongside Sliced Prosciutto, Envy Apple slices, and Whole Grain Crispbread. It adds a splendid spiciness to sandwiches, too.

little-gem-lettuce-076869,Little Gem Lettuce," Aptly enough for its emerald-evoking name, Trader Joe’s Little Gem Lettuce may just be the new crown jewel of our Produce section. The result of cross-breeding between romaine and butter varietals, Little Gem has all the crisp, satisfying bite of romaine, with the tenderness and mild, sweet flavor of butter lettuce. This best-of- both-worlds combo makes it a real rarity among leafy greens—a hidden Gem, if you will—and opens it up to a remarkably wide range of uses within the kitchen. As it turns out, a Little Gem goes a long way!   As a salad green, its toothsome texture and delicate flavor interact wonderfully with all kinds of dressings: try it with a creamy blue cheese, a light and nimble vinaigrette, or our herby and aromatic Green Goddess. In fact, Little Gem leaves are so fit for holding onto various dressings and sauces, that we also recommend using them as a vehicle for appetizer dips, hummus, or tapenades. They’re hearty enough to act as lettuce cups and wraps for various proteins, and durable enough to be halved and grilled on the barbecue (a little char brings out their sweetness even more). Each bag comes with three heads of Lettuce—in other words, these Little Gems are one great big value.

The resulting wine makes people very happy, too! Trader Joe’s Reserve Santa Barbara Pinot Noir Lot #241 is one of those happy-making wines. Its 2021 vintage saw a long growing season, which allowed for the grapes to ripen evenly and for their flavors to really mature, as the grapes spent more time on the vines.    The wine is classically light to medium bodied, aged in French oak. Flavors of ripe cherry, cranberry, and white pepper are beautifully balanced with bright acidity and a silky, fruit-forward finish.

Aging in American oak brings another layer of depth, and at 15% ABV, this is a strong wine in every regard. Pair this one with big flavors to match the wine’s intensity.

These 100% Arabica beans (of the Red Catuai variety) are grown on the La Bastilla Estate, which sits 4,300 feet above sea level in Nicaragua’s mountainous Jinotega region. The Estate’s high altitude and rich, volcanic soils produce coffee with distinctive character and complexity. The beans are carefully hand-picked at peak ripeness, sun- dried on raised beds, then treated to a medium roast—ultimately producing a cup of coffee with layered notes of cocoa, pineapple, cherry, and, of course, blueberry.   Brew a cup or a pot with your French press or automatic coffee maker and sip alongside some sweet breakfast treats, like a Blueberry Muffin, a Cheese Pastry Roll, fresh from the oven, or a toasted Whole Wheat English Muffin.

So… let us give thanks for bagged lettuce—specifically Trader Joe’s Organic Romaine & Chicory Blend.   This Blend pairs crisp leaves of Organic Romaine with two members of the somewhat bitter (in flavor, not attitude) Chicory family—namely frilly, green Organic frisée (also known as curly endive) and sturdy leaves of burgundy-red, white-veined Organic radicchio. Their peppery, slightly spicy notes are pleasantly balanced by cool and crisp Romaine leaves. When combined, this Organic Blend of greens makes for a fast, fresh base for your favorite salad, and lends a thrilling counterpoint of texture when paired with rich, savory foods—think crisp bacon and a poached egg or sautéed Shawarma Chicken Thighs.

Nothing else is added to these Organic Mango Slices, so you get to enjoy pure, authentic Dried Ataulfo Mango, with its pleasantly chewy texture, and honey-sweet flavor.

Here, the hot, humid climate, relatively flat topography, and proximity to the Brahmaputra river create ideal growing conditions for this Organic Assam Black Tea, resulting in its uniquely rich, robust, and slightly malty flavor profile.   Exceptionally delicious when enjoyed as your first morning cup, our Organic Assam Black Tea brews to a dark, golden red and emanates an earthy, spicy aroma that truly invigorates the senses. We find that its full- bodied profile befits pairing with similarly full-flavored fare, like savory breakfast sausage, an omelette with Crunchy Chili Onion, or a plate of chicken and waffles.

chicken-karaage-073030,Chicken Karaage," For many Americans, the mention of fried chicken conjures up large, bone-in, skin-on, chicken breasts that have been soaked in buttermilk, dredged in flour, and deep fried in oil until the exterior is crisp, and the meat is succulent. This kind of chicken is a delicious indulgence, whether from grandma’s kitchen, or delivered in a bucket. However, if you are a fan of Japanese food, “fried chicken” may mean something different—and that (equally delicious) difference can now be experienced in Trader Joe’s Chicken Karaage.   Our Chicken Karaage [ka-RAH-geh] is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, made with a Japanese-inspired recipe. It begins with bite-sized pieces of boneless, skinless, leg meat that have been tenderized and flavor-infused after marinating in rice wine (mirin), soy sauce, and white wine vinegar—along with garlic & ginger powders. Karaage is typically served with lemon wedges, so we intentionally added vinegar to this recipe to mimic that lovely, lemon-like tang you experience when you order the dish in a Japanese restaurant.   The chicken is then dredged in a mixture of wheat flour, cornmeal, and starches, and cooked in soybean oil until crisp. The finished Karaage is frozen and packaged, ready to be reheated and eaten by you! (Use an air fryer if you have one, otherwise a conventional oven will do just fine.) Stack the Chicken pieces on a plate with a garnish of lemon wedges (if you have them), next to a side of the creamy, sweet & savory dipping sauce.

Following fermentation, a small amount of fresh (unfermented) apple juice is added, providing a distinct flavor profile. Thanks to the cold and controlled nature of the fermentation process, our brewer is able to produce the perfect amount of subtle sweetness, which elevates Hotspur’s above so many of the other hard ciders on the market.

Its fruit-forward profile and clean finish are anchored by a pleasant spiciness, courtesy of Zinfandel and Carignane grapes added to the base blend. This is a wine that stands up superbly on its own, while also making an excellent partner to a smoky beef brisket, grilled lamb, or Pasta & meatballs.

big-churn-chardonnay-california-056083,Big Churn Chardonnay California," California Chardonnay is a class of wine unto itself. Each one exists on a point in a vast and wonderful spectrum of flavors and textures, with profiles ranging from cool, refreshing, and bright, to rich, warm, and comforting. It was with this in mind that we approached one of our trusted winery partners with a question—just how far to one side of the spectrum can we swing with a Chardonnay? We all love oaky-buttery Chards, so what if we made the oakiest-butteriest Chard possible? The winery excitedly rose to the challenge and submitted Big Churn, an ode to creamy, toasty California Chardonnay in its fullest possible expression.    With its lush, luxurious body and superbly flavorful finish, this is the wine of your oaky-buttery dreams. We recommend seafood and a side of cruciferous veggies (think braised Brussels sprouts with garlic). Of course, you can simply enjoy it on its own as you admire a summer sunset. You won’t find wine like this anywhere else for under $10, and you won’t find this wine anywhere but Trader Joe’s.

romaine-hearts-037786,Romaine Hearts," Let’s get right to the heart of it, shall we? Simply put, hearts of romaine are the most desirable part of the lettuce.  Maybe it’s the crunch. Maybe it’s the easy-going, ever-so-slightly bitter flavor. Maybe it’s the fact, with, Trader Joe’s Romaine Hearts, all the work has been done. With no dark, outer leaves to trim away, you can use the whole heart, and simply enjoy the fruits of this verdant, versatile vegetable.  Romaine, the modern descendant of the oldest of all lettuce types, adds a delightful, crunchy texture to mixed green salads. In fact, it’s the lettuce of choice for a Caesar, Niçoise, or Cobb salad—a triple threat, if we’ve ever seen one. Romaine leaves bring excellent crunch to a burger or sandwich, and are an excellent option for using as a wrap or lettuce cup. Did you know? Romaine Hearts can even be grilled! Wash the whole Heart, then split it in half and brush with olive oil, grill just until char marks appear, then sprinkle with salt and pepper and serve with or without salad dressing. Now that’s what we call Heart-warming!

dairy-free-mozzarella-style-shreds-066299,Dairy-Free Mozzarella Style Shreds," Admittedly, “cheese alternative” isn’t the most appealing title. That’s why we called our latest product in this vegan vein, Trader Joe’s Mozzarella Style Shreds. Not only is this a better name, it really does describe the eating experience of this product!   We sampled lots and lots of dairy-free “cheeses” and finally settled on this one from a California-based supplier. They start with a crushed-cashew and water base and fortify it with coconut oil, and potato & corn starches. Sea salt and yeast extract add to the “cheesy” flavor, but it’s really the curing of the cashew base over several weeks (a process not too unlike the culturing of real cheese) that gives these Shreds their authentic Mozzarella-Style flavor.   In fact, we think this is such a good cheese alternative, you’ll find the seven-ounce, re-sealable bag of Trader Joe’s Mozzarella Style Shreds hanging in our refrigerators every day, right next to our other shredded cheeses!

How, you ask? Our supplier puts this cashew cheese alternative through a culturating and aging process inspired by traditional cheesemaking techniques. This not only gives each Slice a moderately sharp, Cheddar-like flavor, but mellows its texture to a degree where it melts nice and evenly. Which can only mean one thing: the dream of a satisfyingly melty vegan grilled cheese is now a reality!

gluten-free-multigrain-bread-062146,Gluten Free Multigrain Bread," TJ’s Gluten-Free Multigrain Bread is made for us by a family-owned and operated bakery in a dedicated gluten-free facility using a special blend of brown rice, whole grain sorghum, amaranth, millet, and teff flours— as well as sprouted millet, brown rice, and oats. In addition to providing an impressive two grams of fiber and three grams of protein per two-slice serving, this mix makes the bread soft and flavorful, instead of tough or grainy. In fact, we specifically chose this bread to appeal to non-gluten-free customers just as much as the gluten-free crowd. Because when it comes to bread, you shouldn’t have to compromise.   We recommend toasting a few slices until nicely browned, then piling them high with your favorite deli meat and condiments, with a crisp Organic Kosher Dill Pickle Spear. Or, take advantage of this bread’s hearty nature and combine Crunchy Salted Almond Butter with Fresh Raspberry Preserves for an uncommonly delicious PB&J—that just happens to be gluten-free, too!

Within ten minutes, you can have any number of pesto-marinated chicken dishes plated and waiting for you to dive in.   We begin with a luscious chicken breast sliced in half, scallopini style, to give the breast as much surface area as possible to soak in what comes next: the pesto Genovese marinade. Basil, black pepper, oregano, onion, garlic, salt, parsley, cheese, and oil come together to drench the delicate chicken breast and seep into every nook and cranny - all of this before you even step foot inside your local Trader Joe’s. Our Pesto Genovese Chicken Breast aims to simplify squeezing in a restaurant quality dinner for a fraction of the price or time (and with the bonus of being able to be enjoyed in your pajamas at any given hour). Use this pleasantly pre-marinated pesto poultry to join a nutritious salad for a healthy lunch of meat and veg or take it to the Italian dinner extremes and couple it with your favorite pastas, breadsticks... and don’t forget the vino!

However, when you happen upon a vegan version of an entrée that could genuinely be mistaken for its animal-derived counterpart, even we have to admit: that’s something special. And indeed, Trader Joe’s Italian Vegan Bolognese Ravioli are something special! Each one is filled with a rich and hearty Bolognese-style tomato sauce, with just the right ratio of mushrooms and lentils mixed in to evoke the same toothsome texture and savory, umami flavor you’d find from a meat-based Bolognese.   Like our other fresh ravioli, these Vegan Bolognese Ravioli take only a few minutes in boiling water before they’re perfectly al dente, making them an effortless entrée option for a busy weeknight dinner. While we find that they’re delicious enough with just a splash of olive oil and a sprinkling of chili flakes, they take well to pairing with red sauces, too. If you really wish to bump up the Bolognese factor, while still keeping your plate totally plant-based, you can even serve them with our very own Vegan Bolognese Style Pasta Sauce.

Ultimately, we focused on this cereal’s charming petite-ness, and flamboyant fruity flavor, leading us to call them: Trader Joe’s Tiny Fruity Cuties. Bonus: It’s fun to say!   Our Tiny Fruity Cuties may cause you to reminisce about the fruity, hoopy cereals of your past, but the real tricks are not in the nostalgia. The cereal’s delicious flavor profile and mindful makeup enable it to stand on its own. The corn and oat construction of these Cuties packs a serious crunch; and it’s a crunch sustained even after they soak for some time in your milk bowl. Beyond this tasty texture, their sweet, citrusy flavor yields notes tangy tangerine with whiffs of lemongrass.   We’ve achieved such a delicious profile using natural flavors. And the fun colors come from fruit and vegetable juices. All this colorful, cutie-fruitness may mask the fact that Trader Joe’s Tiny Fruity Cuties are also enriched with essential vitamins and minerals to help start your day off right—which is not to imply that they’re only a breakfast food.

grilled-chicken-strips-075767,Grilled Chicken Strips," When in you’re in the mood for a simple, goes-with-everything kind of protein, you can’t go wrong with a nice piece of grilled chicken. The only trouble, of course, is that when you’re in that something-scrumptious-yet-simple kind of mood, you usually don’t have the time or the temperament to fire up a grill. That’s why we offer our frozen Trader Joe’s Grilled Chicken Strips. Each bag contains a pound of fully-cooked white chicken meat that’s been seasoned with just a touch of savory spices, then cut into highly servable strips. And since they only take a few minutes in the microwave or on the stovetop to go from frozen to steamy, juicy, and ready-to-eat, it’s never been easier to put protein on your plate. If you regularly prep school or work lunches, you’ll especially appreciate how quick, convenient, and tasty these tender, flavorful, Grilled Chicken Strips are. They pair well with all kinds of veggies and starches, and take particularly well to customizing with your favorite sauces and seasonings—we’re partial to tossing them with a bit of Korean Gochujang Sauce, ourselves. They’re a great topper for salads, pastas, and pizzas, phenomenal as a filling for tacos and quesadillas, lovely when layered into sandwiches and wraps, and an easy addition to casseroles and baked enchiladas.

While that may sound like ancient history, think of it as the beginning of American Muenster, and by extension, the birth of Trader Joe’s Sliced Muenster Cheese.   Our Sliced Muenster Cheese is far from the original French Munster where it doesn’t undergo rind-washing or aging, resulting in a mellow flavor with a pleasant tang. The distinctive red-orange rind you see gets its color from annatto which happens to be the same natural vegetable dye used to give Cheddars their vibrant orange hues. Trader Joe’s Sliced Muenster Cheese marries this appearance, texture, and flavor into what is considered one of the great original American cheeses.

They’re also a good source of calcium.   Back in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, sardines were the most commonly consumed canned fish. When a sudden sardine shortage threatened the livelihood of one canner, he began substituting tuna in those cans, and a new industry was born. Sardines, though, returned to abundant levels and have been held in high esteem through the years. Their versatility may be one reason.

Try Trader Joe’s Soyaki as a marinade for chicken, beef, pork or shrimp – the slightly sweet flavor of the sauce is equally delicious grilled, broiled, pan sautéed or baked.

pure-grade-a-maple-syrup-004892,Pure Grade A Maple Syrup," Around 2015, the maple syrup industry initiated a shift in its labeling. Before then, there were three “grades”: A, B and C. The trouble was, while these grades simply referred to color and flavor, consumers often thought each letter had something to do with quality. To avoid confusion, a new system was created in which all maple syrups are called “Grade A,” followed by their specific color and flavor designation.   Here we have Trader Joe’s 100% Maple Syrup – Grade A Amber Color & Rich Taste (first presented in 2006 under the old labeling system). This is the second lightest (both in color and flavor) of the four Grade A syrups. Its lightness is due, in part, to having been tapped mid-season. (Syrups start out lighter and become darker as the season progresses.) Given its particular qualities, this Maple Syrup works well for most eating occasions— from pancake topping, to Old Fashioned sweetening.

sweet-spicy-pecans-078808,Sweet & Spicy Pecans," The venerable pecan, of pie fame, likely grew wild for centuries before being domesticated and cultivated as a major agricultural crop. Today, the United States produces hundreds of thousands of tons of pecans annually – Trader Joe’s doesn’t sell all of them, but we do move a plethora of pecans through our doors each year. We sell raw pecans and roasted pecans, whole pecans, and pieces of pecans. And, these, the pecans de resistance, Sweet & Spicy Pecans.   Trader Joe’s Sweet & Spicy Pecans begin as high quality, fancy junior mammoth (that’s how they’re officially categorized in nut-land; even we couldn’t make that up) pecan halves from Texas.

With that in mind, we’re spicing up summer with Trader Joe’s Organic Pasta Quintet, a pound of – you guessed it! – five fun and festive pasta shapes... in a single bag!   What makes these noodles noteworthy? It starts with the Italian pasta maker sourcing high quality, locally- grown, Organic durum wheat semolina, then going the extra mile to mill the flour themselves. High quality tools are equally essential—bronze coated shaping disks are used to produce thick, textured, mini versions of fusilli, wheels, shells, cavatappi, and spirals that cook up delightfully al dente. The toothsome texture of each piece supports any partnered sauce while maintaining a delicate chew. Plus, every bite of this Pasta is unique, making for a very fun and exciting eating experience.   Cook the Quintet in boiling water for 9-10 minutes until al dente. They go great with pesto, like our Lemon Pesto Sauce, and they’re terrific in a tomato sauce, too. We must mention that they’re superb in summer pasta salads, and magnificent in mac and cheese.Our Organic Pasta Quintet is available for a limited time.

Our most recent venture in finding vegan versions of normally non-vegan fare brought us to a supplier in Greece, who specializes in plant-based cheese alternatives. They made for us this Dairy Free Shredded Spicy Mexican Style Blend, which combines a variety of vegan cheese alternatives into a single, peppery, plant-based blend. We were intrigued. Then, when we saw how well it melted (a notoriously difficult feat for non-dairy products), we were hooked. We think you’ll be, too.  Savory, spicy, and remarkably creamy, Trader Joe’s Dairy Free Shredded Spicy Mexican Style Blend is great for any situation that calls for cheese: topping tacos, filling quesadillas, sprinkling over salads—you name it. With its blend of vegan shreds and savory spices, including cayenne, cumin, and dried jalapeño peppers, it brings a pleasant, building heat to any dish it’s added to.

Already fully cooked, our Thai Vegetable Gyoza easily fulfill your preparation preference – steam, pan fry, microwave, or add to soup. Our favorite method is to heat oil in a pan (or wok); place the potstickers in the hot pan, bottom side down (creases up), and cook over medium-high until browned and crisped; (optional: carefully turn to brown each side); throw a little water into the pan and cover to steam the dumplings off the pan (take care to not add too much water, as the dough can start to come undone).

No need to break any eggs, no need to break a sweat, no need to even break out a knife or fork, if you’d like—these Omelets can be enjoyed handheld and totally on the go!   Each package contains four deliciously cheesy Omelets, which each contain eight grams of protein, making them a smart breakfast option, in addition to an easy one. Plus, they can be quickly customized with your favorite fillings for something more substantial: add some diced bell pepper, onion, and Uncured Black Forest Ham for a mini-Denver omelet, for example.

crumbled-feta-025966,Crumbled Feta," Feta is one of those cheeses that makes you think of a particular geographic region (in this case, the Mediter- ranean), yet is actually made all around the world. In much the same way Swiss cheese is made outside of Switzerland, and you can find delicious Brie made both in and out of France, great-tasting Feta is crafted by cheesemakers the world over. The cheese inside every tub of Trader Joe’s Crumbled Feta is made for us by a fourth generation Wisconsin cheesemaking family, still making cheese where their founding father founded the family creamery in the late 19th century.   The recipe for our Crumbled Feta is simple. It begins with high quality Wisconsin milk from cows that haven’t been treated with synthetic growth hormones. That milk is expertly transformed into firm, crumbly, salty, tangy Feta Cheese, crumbled into bite-sized (or smaller!) pieces, and packed in a resealable tub. The process is simple; the result is magical.   The process may be magical, but the real wonder comes when you put the Feta to use. Sprinkle it onto salads or pizzas for a tangy, creamy addition.

oat-chocolate-bars-with-crispy-rice-cocoa-nibs-075529,Oat Chocolate Bars with Crispy Rice & Cocoa Nibs," In the spring of 2022, we introduced a three-pack of vegan Oat Chocolate Bars. A dairy-defying feat of deliciousness, the oat-based Chocolate is impossibly smooth and creamy, just like milk chocolate—but without milk! Building upon that bodacious base, our buyer worked with the same bean-to-bar supplier in Colombia to develop a crispy counterpart, in the form of Trader Joe’s Oat Chocolate Bars with Crispy Rice & Cocoa Nibs. Made with cane sugar, cocoa butter, and 42% cocoa mass (which is more than the 25%-35% typically found in milk chocolate), the addition of ground oats and rice syrup (think oat “milk”) makes these Bars lusciously—dare we say, ludicrously—creamy. Bite into one of these Bars, however, and you’ll experience a terrific textural transition from magnificently smooth, “I-can’t-believe-it’s-not-milk” chocolate to the delightful crunch of the included Crispy Rice and Cocoa Nibs, along with a touch of sea salt. Like their forebears, these Bars are vegan, soy free, gluten free, and kosher (pareve). They’re also presented as a three-pack of individually wrapped bars for easy, on-the-go enjoyment.

trio-of-soft-licorice-twists-074071,Trio of Soft Licorice Twists," Licorice has long been a favorite among the candy-eating crowd in Australia and New Zealand , going all the way back to the Victorian Era. It wasn’t until the 1950’s, however, that soft and chewy licorice rose to prominence across Australasia. According to legend, one candy company accidentally created a batch far softer than they meant to, and gave it away to local children for free. It proved to be a tremendous hit, and more than 70 years later, it remains one of the most popular styles of licorice globally. Trader Joe’s Trio of Soft Licorice Twists is of this superbly soft and pleasantly chewy variety, and also contain the additional twist (see what we did there?) of coming in three phenomenally fruity flavors: ripe raspberry, tropical mango, and tart green apple.   Ideal for any situation that calls for sweet snacking, Trader Joe’s Trio of Soft Licorice Twists can be enjoyed as a movie candy, a school lunch dessert, or, our personal favorite, as an anytime, “just-because” treat. We find that its complementary mix of flavors strikes a nice balance of consistency and variety: just enough of each to keep every bite interesting.

matcha-green-tea-latte-mix-052512,Matcha Green Tea Latte Mix," Hot tea—in all its varieties—brings warmth, health, and a sense of friendly hospitality to the table. Having known this for centuries, the Japanese developed a ritual called Chado—literally “the Way of Tea”—to celebrate the art of this ancient beverage. Central to this ritual is a very special powdered tea called Matcha. Trader Joe’s Matcha Green Tea Latte Mix puts this exceptional tea right at your fingertips, for all your moments—whether casual or ceremonious.   Many of us associate “powdered” beverages with kids’ drinks—Kool-Aid, anyone? But, before you decide that Matcha is not your cup of tea, get this: In contrast to coarsely prepared leaves of tea that are meant for steep- ing in a bag or infuser, pure Matcha leaves are milled into a fine powder. When whisked into hot water—as ritualized in Chado—this tea-powder dissolves completely, yielding a wholesome cup that maintains all the nutrients, antioxidants, fiber, and chlorophyll found in the original foliage. It’s like eating the leaves right off the tree… just less crunchy!   Because straight Matcha is a little bitter, we couldn’t resist adding some milk and cane sugar to our mix. Combine three tablespoons of the powder to 6 ounces of hot water and you’ll have before you a creamy, sweetened brew with authentic, Green Tea flavor. Perfect for your next Japanese St. Patrick’s Day tea party.

thai-sweet-ginger-sauce-068663,Thai Sweet Ginger Sauce," Ginger is so utterly unique in its flavor, aroma, and even the physical sensations it creates in the mouth, that it almost feels like a culinary gift from nature itself. It’s honestly hard to imagine what global cuisine would look like (or, more importantly, taste like) without this singularly scrumptious root. And now, there’s an easy way to incorporate its inimitable flavor profile to any dish you wish: Trader Joe’s Thai Sweet Ginger Sauce combines the savory, herby sensations of ginger with the rich sweetness of coconut sugar, a touch of pickled garlic, and just a bit of soy sauce to make one seriously versatile condiment. You get sweet, spicy, salty, and garlicky — all in a single sauce.   Made especially for us by a trusted supplier in Thailand, this Sweet Ginger Sauce is practically perfect for serving with a plate of pan-fried Pork Gyoza, but that’s hardly where we’d stop. In fact, we find that its sweet, ginger-y heat makes for excellent dunking with all kinds of savory, meaty dishes, including chicken skewers, samosas, or crispy fried shrimp. Of course, we haven’t forgotten plant-based options: try pouring a bit of our Thai Sweet Ginger Sauce over garlic-fried rice or sautéed Tempeh, or mix with a bit of olive oil and vinegar for a sweet, snappy salad dressing.

strawberry-white-stilton-cheese-076724,Strawberry White Stilton Cheese," England’s highly esteemed Stilton® cheese has been made in the exact same way and in the exact same places as it has been for hundreds of years. It’s so revered, in fact, that it’s protected by the European Union with a PDO, or protected designation of origin, to ensure any cheese bearing the name lives up to its spectacular reputation—cheeses like Trader Joe’s Strawberry White Stilton® Cheese.   Produced for us in Leicestershire, in the heart of the Vale of Belvoir, to be precise, this White Stilton® is made only from locally pasteurized cow’s milk, infused with a pleasant punch of pomegranate powder and fruity, freeze-dried Strawberry pieces. It’s formed into a cylindrical shape, but is not pressed during its one-month aging period to help create an airy texture. The result is a sensationally light, slightly tangy cheese that offers pops of sweetness throughout, complement the savory nature and creamy-crumbly texture of the base.   Consider crumbling a handful of this Strawberry White Stilton® Cheese on a salad or melting a thick slice on a steak. It also presents particularly well on a cheeseboard alongside fresh strawberries (plan ahead—it’s best enjoyed after a 30-minute rest at room temperature). And since each mini-Cheese wheel (endearingly called a truckle in the cheese world) is encased in a thick, non-edible, bright red wax, it can be easily popped in a purse or packed in a picnic basket—don’t forget the cutting board and knife!

We knew right away that it was destined for our shelves, in the form of Trader Joe’s Passion Fruit Rounds.   Our supplier in Vietnam—an expert in all things dried fruit—makes each bag of our Passion Fruit Rounds by taking passion fruit seeds, along with the sweet, tart, and delighftully tropical pulp that surrounds them, and combines them with a bit of apple juice and sugar to provide some extra body. They then pour the whole mixture into disc-shaped molds, and dehydrate the whole mix it until it reaches a charmingly chewy texture. Together, the combo of sweet and sour, chewy and crunchy (courtesy of the generously-studded seeds throughout) create a harmonious balance that’s as unique as the passion fruit itself is. We recommend enjoying them as a quick, fruity snack, as a sweet treat to munch while watching a movie, or as a fun bit of cocktail decor, affixed to the rim of something sweet and tangy.

josephsbrau-summer-brew-175113,Josephsbrau Summer Brew," Josephsbrau Summer Brew is brewed for us by a respected West Coast craft brewer who marries modern day technology with old-world recipes. In this particular case, they’re using top-fermenting ale yeast that is fermented at colder, lager-style temperatures. This creates an ale-lager hybrid in the Kölsch style. Ingredients include German ale yeast, quality two-row malted barley, and Hallertauer & Tetnang hops. With a golden straw hue and a creamy head, this beer presents a light-hop profile that’s delicious and refreshing.   Summer Brew is ready to pair with all the foods that go along with the warmer months. Enjoy while grilling burgers and Uncured Bavarian Brats. Or savor some poured in a chilled glass and paired with a crisp, Lemony Arugula Basil Salad and sautéed Argentinian Red Shrimp.   Formerly available in glass bottles, Josephsbrau Summer Brew is now available in six-packs of 12-ounce cans. Cans not only protect beer from damaging light exposure, but they are also more often and more easily recycled than glass bottles. They’re also faster to chill, and virtually unbreakable.

chocolate-vanilla-bean-swirl-gelato-075851,Chocolate & Vanilla Bean Swirl Gelato," In Italian, “gelato” is the word for “ice cream” in general. Most Italian ice cream, however, is made in a certain style—so when stateside treat-seekers are referring to gelato, they are typically talking about an Italian-style ice cream. An ice cream that’s intensely creamy, yet surprisingly refreshing. An ice cream that’s wondrously light, yet velvety and dense.   TJ’s Chocolate & Vanilla Bean Swirl Gelato is made for us by an Italian supplier using more milk than cream, yielding a lower butterfat content than you’d find in American-style ice cream. This gives the Gelato a light, refreshing quality while still remaining delectably smooth and creamy, and allows its Chocolate and Vanilla Bean flavors (courtesy of cocoa, semisweet chocolate, and actual vanilla bean specks) and its sweet, chocolate-sauce Swirl to really shine.   Instead of a traditional pint, we’ve very intentionally packed our Chocolate & Vanilla Bean Swirl Gelato in a 1.9-pint (900mL), clear, rectangular tub. Peel off the lid, and the Gelato’s dazzling peaks and swirls will conjure up all the beautifully decorated, sumptuous ripples you’d find in an authentic, Italian gelateria!

(To complete the picture, ravioli’s smaller-in-stature cousin is called ravioletti.)   As its name would imply, Trader Joe’s Italian Tomato & Burrata Ravioloni is made for us in Italy and double- stuffed with creamy burrata cheese and a trio of tomatoes (crushed, roasted, and dried), plus mozzarella, butter, breadcrumbs, and a bit of basil paste. The pasta itself is delicate, toothsome, and two-toned—one side of each Ravioloni is red, and the other is green, thanks to tomato powder and spinach, respectively.

spicy-honey-sauce-076116,Spicy Honey Sauce," When sweet and savory come together successfully, it’s always magical. If you can combine sweet and spicy, specifically, that’s an entirely different level of magic. A few years ago, we achieved such sorcery with a delicately spiced honey sauce that left us dreaming of all the different dishes over which we could drizzle it. With a list so long, we decided to bump up the bottle size (by four ounces!), crank up the heat (it’ll prompt a pleasant ooh after every taste), and offer it for the very same price as the previous, smaller version! This new iteriation of Trader Joe’s Spicy Honey Sauce delivers a harmonious intermingling of rich, aromatic honey and a thrilling kick from chili extract, held together with a bit of vinegar. This has the transformative power to augment sweet and savory dishes alike, turning merely delicious meals into transcendent ones.   From something as simple as a baked sweet potato to something as rich as a slice of New York Cheesecake, a drizzling of Spicy Honey Sauce instantly gives anything it’s added to an extra element of complexity. Try it on sandwiches, pizza, or tacos for an elevated everyday eating experience. Give it a go over freshly baked Organic Biscuits, air-fried Breaded Chicken Tenderloin Breasts, roasted veggies, or barbecued shrimp skewers for a bit of epicurean experimentation. Add some oomph to salad dressings, BBQ glazes, and marinades with a generous squeeze. And if you’re really adventurous, you can even try it with pancakes, parfaits, or mixed into tequila- and rum-based cocktails. Magical, indeed.

josephsbrau-hefeweizen-175189,Josephsbrau Hefeweizen," Like all of the products we sell, Trader Joe’s takes beers very seriously. This is well illustrated in Josephsbrau Bavarian Style Hefeweizen. Though it’s made for us through a partnership with one of the foremost crafter breweries of the West Coast, it’s brewed with imported malt and hops under the strictest interpretation of the Reinheitsgebot, a strict set of laws from 16th century Bavaria that determined that beers could only contain barley, hops, and water. Of course, the Reinheitsgebot has been updated since the 16th century to make way for other beer styles, including Hefeweizen, which necessarily includes wheat in its recipe.   Josephsbrau Hefeweizen is fermented with a special wheat beer yeast strain from Bavaria (hefeweizen literally means: “wheat yeast”). This unique yeast produces an array of flavors typical of an authentic Hefeweizen including: citrus, clove, banana, and even hints of bubble gum. This beer’s unfiltered golden color, combined with its lightly hopped, lightly malted character, makes it wonderfully refreshing to sip by itself. It also pairs extremely well with a grilled Uncured Bavarian Bratwurst or our Sweet Italian Chicken Sausage.

The spiciness of this Jalapeño Limeade is mild enough for even the wariest spicy food consumers—and will be pleasantly enjoyable for those who seek heat. Our Jalapeño Limeade might sound elaborate, but it’s actually quite simple. It’s made with water, organic lime juice that’s not from concentrate, organic cane sugar, and organic jalapeño powder. The burst of tart lime pairs perfectly with a kick of jalapeño flavor for a mighty refreshing drink.   Is there a better drink to enjoy during the height of summer—or to remind you of summer on those less-than- summery days? Probably not.

sfogliatella-pastry-074252,Sfogliatella Pastry," Do you remember our finger-friendly, fall-season appetizer called Eggplant Parmigiana Sfogliatelle? We created those savory morsels in the image of a sweet pastry called Sfogliatella [sfoh-lee-ah-TELL-a], which has roots in Napoli, Italy. Our Eggplant Sfogliatelle were such a success (and they’re coming back next holiday season!), it only made sense to introduce our customers to the unique treat upon which they were based. Say hello to Trader Joe’s Naples Style Sfogliatella Pastry!   In Italian, Sfogliatella means “small, thin leaf or layer,” which speaks to the incredibly fine, crisp layers that make up the exterior of this pastry. The laborious lamination technique used to create our Sfogliatella is done almost entirely by hand, by artisans skilled in the Sfogliatella craft. It involves making what amounts to pasta dough, which is rolled into long, super-thin sheets, and topped with vegetable-oil. The sheets are then rolled into a long cylinder, creating dozens of thin layers. Finally, the cylinder is cut into discs that are each gently hand-pressed into a wide, conical shape. After being loaded with a delicious filling that includes ricotta cheese and candied orange peel, the Pastries are partially closed, somewhat resembling a clam shell.   In addition to their authentic construction and amazing taste, what really makes Trader Joe’s Classic Naples Style Sfogliatella Pastry stand out from other versions is their ease of preparation. They’re ready to bake from frozen (no proofing), and can be enjoyed after just 35-40 minutes in your 350°F conventional oven!

old-fashioned-blister-peanuts-016126,Old Fashioned Blister Peanuts," Back in the old days, people used to soak raw peanuts in water to remove those thin, red skins before they roasted them. The residual moisture would interact with the oil during roasting and cause little bubbles or “blisters” to form on the outside of the nuts. Instead of being unwelcome, these serendipitous blisters added texture—ultimately creating a unique peanut snack.   Trader Joe’s Old Fashioned Blister Peanuts harken back to these original “blistereds,” as they were once called. While water is no longer required to remove peanut skins (there are new technologies for that) our supplier still blanches extra large Virginia peanuts in hot water before roasting them in peanut oil and adding salt.

You shouldn’t get caught in circular snacking with Trader Joe’s Snacky Clusters because each piece includes both salty and sweet elements. We’ve taken Sea Salt Potato Chips, Corn Chip Dippers, and Mini Pretzel Nuggets, and crushed them, then we’ve mixed everything with creamy milk chocolate and divided the resulting combination into bite-sized Clusters. The upshot of this innovation is that each bite begins with smooth, sweet chocolate, and is quickly followed by the salted crunch of Chips and Nuggets. Snacking conundrum solved!   Of course, it’s possible that we may have inadvertently created a new snacking cycle that goes like: Trader Joe’s Snacky Cluster, followed by another Trader Joe’s Snacky Cluster... often followed again by a Trader Joe’s Snacky Cluster, etc. ","['Food', 'Snacks & Sweets', 'Candies & Cookies']",https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/snacky-clusters-074539,$3.99,8 Oz,https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m21002/74539.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280,Kosher,"['MILK CHOCOLATE (SUGAR, MILK, UNSWEETENED CHOCOLATE, COCOA BUTTER, SOY LECITHIN [EMULSIFIER], NATURAL VANILLA FLAVOR)', 'POTATO CHIPS (POTATOES, SUNFLOWER OIL, SEA SALT)', 'CORN CHIP DIPPERS (YELLOW CORN MEAL, CANOLA AND/OR SUNFLOWER AND/OR SAFFLOWER OIL, SEA SALT)', 'MINI PRETZEL NUGGETS (UNBLEACHED ENRICHED FLOUR [WHEAT FLOUR, NIACIN, REDUCED IRON, THIAMINE MONONITRATE, RIBOFLAVIN, FOLIC ACID], MALTED BARLEY FLOUR, SALT, SOYBEAN OIL, SODIUM HYDROXIDE [PROCESSING AID]).']","CONTAINS MILK, SOY , WHEAT.","['Desk Drawer', 'Family Style', 'Finger Food', 'Game Night', 'Midday Snacks', 'Treat Yourself', 'Yes!']",['1oz(30g/ about 4 pieces)'],['160 ']

matcha-green-tea-latte-mix-052512,Matcha Green Tea Latte Mix," Hot tea—in all its varieties—brings warmth, health, and a sense of friendly hospitality to the table. Having known this for centuries, the Japanese developed a ritual called Chado—literally “the Way of Tea”—to celebrate the art of this ancient beverage. Central to this ritual is a very special powdered tea called Matcha. Trader Joe’s Matcha Green Tea Latte Mix puts this exceptional tea right at your fingertips, for all your moments—whether casual or ceremonious.   Many of us associate “powdered” beverages with kids’ drinks—Kool-Aid, anyone? But, before you decide that Matcha is not your cup of tea, get this: In contrast to coarsely prepared leaves of tea that are meant for steep- ing in a bag or infuser, pure Matcha leaves are milled into a fine powder. When whisked into hot water—as ritualized in Chado—this tea-powder dissolves completely, yielding a wholesome cup that maintains all the nutrients, antioxidants, fiber, and chlorophyll found in the original foliage. It’s like eating the leaves right off the tree… just less crunchy!   Because straight Matcha is a little bitter, we couldn’t resist adding some milk and cane sugar to our mix. Combine three tablespoons of the powder to 6 ounces of hot water and you’ll have before you a creamy, sweetened brew with authentic, Green Tea flavor.

You get sweet, spicy, salty, and garlicky — all in a single sauce.   Made especially for us by a trusted supplier in Thailand, this Sweet Ginger Sauce is practically perfect for serving with a plate of pan-fried Pork Gyoza, but that’s hardly where we’d stop. In fact, we find that its sweet, ginger-y heat makes for excellent dunking with all kinds of savory, meaty dishes, including chicken skewers, samosas, or crispy fried shrimp. Of course, we haven’t forgotten plant-based options: try pouring a bit of our Thai Sweet Ginger Sauce over garlic-fried rice or sautéed Tempeh, or mix with a bit of olive oil and vinegar for a sweet, snappy salad dressing.

buttermilk-ranch-dressing-074462,Buttermilk Ranch Dressing," Since its invention in the middle of the 20th century, ranch has taken on a culinary life of its own. In addition to its status as the best-selling style of salad dressing in the U.S. for over three decades, it’s also earned the title of best-selling condiment in the U.S. in recent years—even more so than ketchup! Beloved for how well its creamy, herby flavor profile enhances French fries, carrot sticks, chicken wings, pizza, and everything in between, ranch is a powerhouse of “put-it-on-everything” practicality, and Trader Joe’s Buttermilk Ranch Dressing ably demonstrates why.   Each bottle is made with a classic recipe that starts with a base of cultured buttermilk, sour cream, and mayonnaise, and flavored with an array of aromatic herbs and seasonings including garlic, chives, dill, and shallots. Cool, creamy, and delightfully old-fashioned, our Buttermilk Ranch serves spectacularly well in a salad with nearly any leafy green [though we’re particularly partial to one made with Butter Lettuce. Unsurprisingly, it also makes an excellent dip, condiment, or spread for all kinds of savory snacks, appetizers, or sandwiches, respectively. What might surprise you, however, is the fact that even with its rich, creamy consistency, each two-tablespoon serving contains only 70 calories.

Much of it, unfortunately, about companies trying to pass off lower grades of olive oil as extra virgin. Trader Joe’s, we’re happy to report, is not among those named. In fact, our olive oils are consistently praised for their authenticity, their quality, and their overall value compared to competitors. We know it’s not terribly humble of us to agree with these assessments, but alas, we do. Our olive oil rocks!   Among the selection, and one we’re enjoying right now, is Trader Joe’s Premium Extra Virgin Olive Oil. In the bottle is cold-pressed oil from olives grown in Italy, Spain, Argentina, and Greece. The oil is carefully blended in Italy and shipped to the United States, where it is packed exclusively for us. This particular blend creates an Extra Virgin Olive Oil that’s golden green in color, pleasantly pungent and slightly grassy, with fruity flavors and a peppery finish. It’s a terrific all-around kitchen worker—great in salad dressings, pasta dishes, marinades, and sautéing.

Trader Joe’s Mild Pico De Gallo is an edible tribute to this scion of salsas, an easy option for when you need fresh pico de gallo, but don’t quite have the time for all that chopping.   Made in the classic style using diced tomatoes, onions, jalapeños, cilantro, and lemon juice, our Pico De Gallo isn’t just an ideal companion to tortilla chips, it’s also an excellent (and easy) recipe enhancer. Looking to spice up a bit of pan-fried fish? A layer of chunky Pico De Gallo will add just the right amount of zest. Making a quick Tex-Mex queso? Simply add a tub of Trader Joe’s Mild Pico De Gallo to a skillet of melted cheese and milk, and you’re there, compadre.

Some might say these basics and building blocks are a little less exciting than our more fanciful foodstuffs, but we respectfully disagree. Take Trader Joe’s Unbleached Enriched All-Purpose Flour, for instance. Made from a base of unbleached, ground wheat, and enriched with vitamins and minerals like iron, niacin, and folic acid for an extra nutritional nudge, this Flour serves as the starting point for all sorts of kitchen adventures of your own. And what’s more exciting than that? When we say All-Purpose, we mean it: whether you’ve got biscuits to bake, pizza dough to throw, or cutlets to dredge, our Unbleached Flour will get the job done.

raw-milk-cave-aged-le-gruyere-097621,Raw Milk Cave Aged Le Gruyère," A Swiss cheese without holes? You must be joking! Well, look again and you’ll uncover a dense, firm, pale yellow Swiss cheese that is naturally smooth and devoid of the “eyes” found in its sibling cheese. Cave Aged Le Gruyère Switzerland AOP Cheese is our Gruyère offering, bringing the Medieval Alpine cheese to live amongst our fridges and be discovered by our shoppers for a creamy, nutty flavor not found in other cheeses.   An inimitable flavor and made with the utmost regard for quality, Cave Aged Le Gruyère’s production can be distilled into eight simple parts: the use of high quality, part skim cow’s milk; curdling of the milk in copper vats; cutting, mixing, and heating the curds; placing the paste into molds; bathing in salt and beginning the cheese’s storage; maturation in aging cellars; taxation by experts to denote that the cheese is of the quality to bear the Le Gruyère AOP name; and additional maturation time. The additional maturation of this specific Le Gruyère is a key to the final taste and texture. It’s aged in extremely humid “affinage” (maturation) cellars to keep the cheese moist while taking on the strong, bold flavors of a cheese that’s been given time alone to age.   Not every cheese turns to a warm, decadent, ooey gooey pool of delight that you want to dive and dip into, but with Gruyère, we do get that pleasure. It takes a cheese made with rennet (as opposed to a cheese curdled with acid) to be a melting cheese, and then it takes a cheese with a high water-to-fat ratio to be a good melting cheese. Trader Joe’s Cave Aged Le Gruyère is a good melting cheese and goes wonderfully melted into sandwiches or enjoyed at room temp, solid, firm, and delicious!

sweet-plantain-chips-055085,Sweet Plantain Chips," The Quindío region of Colombia is part of the so-called “coffee triangle” (Triángulo del Café), widely considered one of the best places to grow coffee beans. It is less widely considered one of the best places to grow plantains… but this doesn’t make that fact any less true! The volcanic soil, altitude, proximity to the equatorial line, and consistent climate make this region an exceptional environment for growing this banana cultivar.   Trader Joe’s Sweet Plantain Chips start with plantains grown in this very region. Bunches are harvested by hand to reduce bruising. After harvest, the plantains are allowed extra time to ripen to a sweetness of 24 brix (natural sugar content level), as opposed to only 12 brix—a more typical number for other plantain growers. The profoundly sweet, ripe plantains are also exceedingly soft at this point—almost too soft to cut. Our Colombian supplier carefully peels each plantain by hand, and hand-feeds each one into a cutting machine to further protect the fruit. The sweet plantain slices then take a quick dip in hot sunflower oil, just until perfectly crisp. When your hand reaches into the bag, you’ll pull out a handful of crunchy, gluten free “chips” with a sweetness all their own (absolutely no sugar is added). While they’re a superb standalone snack, they also synergize spectacularly with all kinds of dips, but especially ones that have a bit of sweet and savory to them, like our Pineapple Salsa.

Once the masa is rolled flat and machine-cut into uniform triangles, the chips take not one, not two, but three passes through an open-flame conveyer oven.

jicama-sticks-055482,Jicama Sticks," As with the word “quinoa,” the word “jicama” is sometimes mispronounced. It’s not kwin-Oh-ah, it’s keen- WAH. Likewise, it’s not juh-KAI-ma, it’s HICK-a-muh. Now, that we’ve got that out of the way…   Also called the “yam bean,” (much easier to pronounce), jicama is native to Central and South America. It was originally cultivated by all major Mesoamerican civilizations. This root vegetable is shaped like an overgrown flat onion. It has papery, brown skin, which hides beneath it, crisp, white flesh.   The Jicama’s bulky size and odd shape make preparing it a cumbersome ordeal. This got us thinking: What if we took care of the painful prep stage for you? We presumed that if we did, more people would become eager fans of this refreshing, underutilized vegetable. So, we did. We peeled the skin and cut the flesh into ready-to-serve sticks.   The mild, sweet-starchy flavor of jicama (sometimes described as a mix between pear flesh and potato flesh) makes the perfect blank canvas for dips—especially shaped like sticks, as these are. The wonderful crunch makes a great addition to fresh salsas and salads—just chop our sticks into smaller, bite-sized pieces. Jicama also works well cooked into stir-frys and soups.

Glad you asked…   Chhurpi, or durkha, is an extremely hard cheese native to the Himalayas, traditionally made from Yak’s milk or buttermilk (ours is made from a blend of both). The milk gets boiled, then the curds are wrapped in a thin cloth and hung out to dry for several days. Once the cheese is quite firm, it’s sliced into strips or cubes and dried over a fire or in an oven on low heat.   At this point in the process, Chhurpi makes an excellent human snack, but to make its texture extra dog- friendly, our Nepalese supplier takes it a step further by microwaving the chhurpi nuggets. This forces the cheese to “puff ” — kind of like microwave popcorn — and turns it into crunchy, savory treats your pup will be begging for!

Out of your oven, the bread becomes delightfully warm, the cheese wonderfully gooey, and the jalapeños satisfyingly crisp.

cape-gooseberries-091624,Cape Gooseberries," Cape Gooseberries (aka “Golden Berries”) are the very definition of superfruit. Their size and shape make one think first of cherry tomatoes.

And then there are the dried green leaves that enclose each Gooseberry, like a tomatillo—or a superhero’s cape, fittingly enough. So what exactly is a Cape Gooseberry?!   Ours are grown in South America, from whence Gooseberries are native, and where they’ve been grown since the days of the Incan empire. Slice into one and you’ll find moist seeds suspended like the inside a tomato or tomatillo—though more plentiful. (Incidentally, these Berries arrive in our stores with the tomatillo-like leaves removed.) Take a taste and you’ll discover they’re juicy and quite tart, reminiscent of sour candy, but still including hints of sweet, tropical-fruit flavor.    Nutritionally, Cape Gooseberries have an impressive amount of antioxidants, along with plenty of fiber, vitamin C, and other important vitamins and minerals. With their earned “superfood” status, Gooseberries make an obvious choice for adding to smoothies. Their tart character makes them ideal for simmering with sugar to create pie filling or jams.

In the years since, the dekopon, as it’s known in its home country, has become a global sensation, beloved for its sweet, almost candy-like flavor, charmingly craggy skin, and signature, top knot-like bump. The ones you’ll find at Trader Joe’s are grown in California’s San Joaquin Valley, where the climate is ideal for producing these fabulously flavorful Citrus.   On picking up a Sumo Citrus®, you’ll likely be struck by the bumpy texture of its soft, loose-fitting peel. After removing the peel, you’ll then likely be struck by the ease with which its thin-membraned, seedless segments come apart. And on first bite, you’ll most certainly be struck by its marvelous sweetness and profound juiciness.

all-natural-heirloom-whole-chicken-067607,All Natural Heirloom Whole Chicken," Trader Joe’s All Natural Heirloom Whole Chicken is a very special chicken. First, it comes from a recognized breed with a genetic line that traces back multiple generations. And unlike so many other chickens raised very quickly on processed meal and antibiotics, these Heirloom Chickens are slow-growth, pasture-raised birds. This means they are allowed to mature at a natural rate and forage for food in a natural environment. They also have never been given antibiotics.   What’s more, instead of using the common methods of water or ice chilling (which lead to water retention and muted flavor), our supplier air chills each Chicken allowing them to retain their full flavor.

Our Wisconsin cheesemonger concocts this Blueberry beauty in small batches and cures it using top-secret, artisanal methods to achieve its delicate texture—this makes the Cheese ideal for slicing and serving on summer cheese boards, melting in a turkey panini, or shaving atop a spinach salad with fresh blueberries & candied pecans.

french-heritage-saint-paulin-cheese-076428,French Heritage Saint Paulin Cheese," When happening upon a wedge of our latest Spotlight Cheese, Saint Paulin, at your neighborhood Trader Joe’s, the first thing that will likely catch your eye is its signature golden-orange rind. Like its culinary cousin Port Salut, Saint Paulin was originally created by Trappist monks in France, and its vibrant exterior is an artifact of the traditional cheesemaking methods that are still employed in its production. As the cheese ages, it’s washed in brine to increase the presence of a particular bacteria strain, which creates an enzyme that helps each wheel of Saintt Paulin develop its mild, buttery flavor, and rich, floral aroma—and also just happens to leave a vibrantly ruddy hue.   Delectably creamy, with a smooth, semisoft consistency and totally edible rind (another benefit of the brine washing process), our Saint Paulin makes an attractive addition to any charcuterie board or cheese plate. We find that it’s especially suited for pairing with sweeter flavors, like fresh cut fruit, Fig Butter, or our Spicy Honey Sauce. For an elevated take on comfort food fare, try slicing it and adding it to a grilled cheese, panini, or patty melt.

organic-baby-spinach-032603,Organic Baby Spinach," For all the talk about “super” foods and “super” greens in particular, there’s one that routinely gets left out of the conversation. Spinach. Spinach may not be hip or trendy, but it’s a stalwart standby that always lives up to expectations. Cultivated stateside since the early 19th century, spinach had been a European staple for a thousand years before that. It was in the 20th century that spinach first got its “superfood” status – from a comic strip character, no less! And while it was silly when Popeye’s muscles suddenly bulged after eating a can of spinach, there was also, in fact, some truth to that story.   At Trader Joe’s, we have fresh Organic Baby Spinach that definitely passes the Popeye test – and without the can, thankfully. It’s loaded with nutrients, tastes great and is good for you any way you decide to enjoy it. In a salad with blue cheese and candied walnuts, in a hearty homemade soup, blended into a smoothie (use a powerful blender), or sautéed with a touch of olive oil and garlic, our Organic Baby Spinach will not disappoint. It’s pre-washed and ready to eat, making it an effortless choice to include in your meal planning. Now that’s super.

If you can combine sweet and spicy, specifically, that’s an entirely different level of magic. A few years ago, we achieved such sorcery with a delicately spiced honey sauce that left us dreaming of all the different dishes over which we could drizzle it. With a list so long, we decided to bump up the bottle size (by four ounces!), crank up the heat (it’ll prompt a pleasant ooh after every taste), and offer it for the very same price as the previous, smaller version! This new iteriation of Trader Joe’s Spicy Honey Sauce delivers a harmonious intermingling of rich, aromatic honey and a thrilling kick from chili extract, held together with a bit of vinegar. This has the transformative power to augment sweet and savory dishes alike, turning merely delicious meals into transcendent ones.   From something as simple as a baked sweet potato to something as rich as a slice of New York Cheesecake, a drizzling of Spicy Honey Sauce instantly gives anything it’s added to an extra element of complexity. Try it on sandwiches, pizza, or tacos for an elevated everyday eating experience. Give it a go over freshly baked Organic Biscuits, air-fried Breaded Chicken Tenderloin Breasts, roasted veggies, or barbecued shrimp skewers for a bit of epicurean experimentation. Add some oomph to salad dressings, BBQ glazes, and marinades with a generous squeeze. And if you’re really adventurous, you can even try it with pancakes, parfaits, or mixed into tequila- and rum-based cocktails. Magical, indeed.

josephsbrau-hefeweizen-175189,Josephsbrau Hefeweizen," Like all of the products we sell, Trader Joe’s takes beers very seriously. This is well illustrated in Josephsbrau Bavarian Style Hefeweizen. Though it’s made for us through a partnership with one of the foremost crafter breweries of the West Coast, it’s brewed with imported malt and hops under the strictest interpretation of the Reinheitsgebot, a strict set of laws from 16th century Bavaria that determined that beers could only contain barley, hops, and water. Of course, the Reinheitsgebot has been updated since the 16th century to make way for other beer styles, including Hefeweizen, which necessarily includes wheat in its recipe.   Josephsbrau Hefeweizen is fermented with a special wheat beer yeast strain from Bavaria (hefeweizen literally means: “wheat yeast”). This unique yeast produces an array of flavors typical of an authentic Hefeweizen including: citrus, clove, banana, and even hints of bubble gum. This beer’s unfiltered golden color, combined with its lightly hopped, lightly malted character, makes it wonderfully refreshing to sip by itself.

The spiciness of this Jalapeño Limeade is mild enough for even the wariest spicy food consumers—and will be pleasantly enjoyable for those who seek heat. Our Jalapeño Limeade might sound elaborate, but it’s actually quite simple. It’s made with water, organic lime juice that’s not from concentrate, organic cane sugar, and organic jalapeño powder. The burst of tart lime pairs perfectly with a kick of jalapeño flavor for a mighty refreshing drink.   Is there a better drink to enjoy during the height of summer—or to remind you of summer on those less-than- summery days? Probably not.

sfogliatella-pastry-074252,Sfogliatella Pastry," Do you remember our finger-friendly, fall-season appetizer called Eggplant Parmigiana Sfogliatelle? We created those savory morsels in the image of a sweet pastry called Sfogliatella [sfoh-lee-ah-TELL-a], which has roots in Napoli, Italy. Our Eggplant Sfogliatelle were such a success (and they’re coming back next holiday season!), it only made sense to introduce our customers to the unique treat upon which they were based. Say hello to Trader Joe’s Naples Style Sfogliatella Pastry!   In Italian, Sfogliatella means “small, thin leaf or layer,” which speaks to the incredibly fine, crisp layers that make up the exterior of this pastry. The laborious lamination technique used to create our Sfogliatella is done almost entirely by hand, by artisans skilled in the Sfogliatella craft. It involves making what amounts to pasta dough, which is rolled into long, super-thin sheets, and topped with vegetable-oil. The sheets are then rolled into a long cylinder, creating dozens of thin layers. Finally, the cylinder is cut into discs that are each gently hand-pressed into a wide, conical shape. After being loaded with a delicious filling that includes ricotta cheese and candied orange peel, the Pastries are partially closed, somewhat resembling a clam shell.   In addition to their authentic construction and amazing taste, what really makes Trader Joe’s Classic Naples Style Sfogliatella Pastry stand out from other versions is their ease of preparation. They’re ready to bake from frozen (no proofing), and can be enjoyed after just 35-40 minutes in your 350°F conventional oven!

Trader Joe’s Old Fashioned Blister Peanuts harken back to these original “blistereds,” as they were once called.

In fact, only vanilla harvested from islands in the Indian Ocean, like Île Bourbon (now known as Réunion) can be called Bourbon Vanilla. And that’s precisely what you’ll find in each bottle of Trader Joe’s Organic Pure Bourbon Vanilla Extract.   Bold, full-flavored, and grown using organic certified practices, this Pure Bourbon Vanilla Extract is ideal for use in making your favorite baked goods, stirring into frostings or icings, or even dropping a bit into smoothies, pancake mixes, or oatmeal.

mee-krob-snackers-074787,Mee Krob Snackers," A long-favored fixture of Thai restaurant menus the world over, mee krob (also spelled “mi krop”) is a superbly savory dish comprised of thin, crispy-fried rice noodles tossed in a rich, aromatic, sweet and sour sauce. Sometimes an entrée, sometimes an appetizer, and always a treat, some of our Buyers recently had the opportunity to try mee krob in Thailand for themselves. After taking in its complex flavors and chewy, crispy textures, inspiration struck, and they immediately began working with one of our Thai suppliers to create Trader Joe’s Mee Krob Snackers.   To make each batch of these shelf stable, vegan, gluten free mee krob morsels, our supplier starts much in the same way you would make mee krob in a restaurant setting: they deep fry rice noodles until they’re superlatively crispy, then add bits of fried garlic, fried shallot, and cashews for even more crunch. After that, they layer in a super flavorful sauce made with tamarind paste, vinegar, chili sauce, lime juice, and sugar. Once the noodles have soaked up the sauce and cooled down, they’re cut into one-or-two-bite squares, and voila: Snackers! Aside from being an excellent anytime snack, we’re particularly fond of them as an accompaniment for a spicy, curry-seasoned soup, a base for fancy seafood hors d’oeuvres, or as crouton for a sweet, citrus-y salad.

As you might surmise from the fact that it’s Plant-Based, this Spread is totally free of dairy and lactose, and we should also mention that it’s gluten-free, soy-free, and kosher (pareve), too. In addition to its appetizing applications on a warm slice of toast or pile of pancakes, we’ve found its already soft consistency makes it a great tool for crafting vegan compound butters.

smoky-hot-chile-powder-074709,Smoky & Hot Chile Powder," You might call paprika and chile powder two sides of the same peppery, piquant coin. While both are made with dried, ground peppers, paprika is typically made with a single, relatively milder varietal of pepper, and is usually crafted to emphasize one aspect of that pepper’s flavor—sometimes it’s sweet, sometimes it’s super aromatic, and often, it’s smoked. Chile powder, on the other hand, tends to be made with a wider variety of peppers, which are usually chosen for their heat level. When mixed together, as they often are in dishes like paella, chili, and shakshua, they express the whole of the pepper’s potential. And when carefully balanced into a single spice blend, as they are in Trader Joe’s Smoky & Hot Chile Powder, they create a highly versatile seasoning that brings a smoky, savory kick to dishes of all kinds.   Made with just the right ratio of smoked paprika and chile powder to create just the right ratio of smoke to heat, our Smoky & Hot Chile Powder is super handy for making savory soups, sauces, and stews, and nearly indispensable when creating homemade BBQ rubs and Cajun-style seasonings. It adds a remarkable depth of flavor when sprinkled over scrambled eggs, roasted veggies, or grilled seafood, and can take snack foods like popcorn and potato chips into an entirely new dimension.

buttermilk-ranch-dressing-074462,Buttermilk Ranch Dressing," Since its invention in the middle of the 20th century, ranch has taken on a culinary life of its own.

Beloved for how well its creamy, herby flavor profile enhances French fries, carrot sticks, chicken wings, pizza, and everything in between, ranch is a powerhouse of “put-it-on-everything” practicality, and Trader Joe’s Buttermilk Ranch Dressing ably demonstrates why.   Each bottle is made with a classic recipe that starts with a base of cultured buttermilk, sour cream, and mayonnaise, and flavored with an array of aromatic herbs and seasonings including garlic, chives, dill, and shallots. Cool, creamy, and delightfully old-fashioned, our Buttermilk Ranch serves spectacularly well in a salad with nearly any leafy green [though we’re particularly partial to one made with Butter Lettuce. Unsurprisingly, it also makes an excellent dip, condiment, or spread for all kinds of savory snacks, appetizers, or sandwiches, respectively.

We know it’s not terribly humble of us to agree with these assessments, but alas, we do. Our olive oil rocks!

raw-milk-cave-aged-le-gruyere-097621,Raw Milk Cave Aged Le Gruyère," A Swiss cheese without holes? You must be joking! Well, look again and you’ll uncover a dense, firm, pale yellow Swiss cheese that is naturally smooth and devoid of the “eyes” found in its sibling cheese. Cave Aged Le Gruyère Switzerland AOP Cheese is our Gruyère offering, bringing the Medieval Alpine cheese to live amongst our fridges and be discovered by our shoppers for a creamy, nutty flavor not found in other cheeses.   An inimitable flavor and made with the utmost regard for quality, Cave Aged Le Gruyère’s production can be distilled into eight simple parts: the use of high quality, part skim cow’s milk; curdling of the milk in copper vats; cutting, mixing, and heating the curds; placing the paste into molds; bathing in salt and beginning the cheese’s storage; maturation in aging cellars; taxation by experts to denote that the cheese is of the quality to bear the Le Gruyère AOP name; and additional maturation time. The additional maturation of this specific Le Gruyère is a key to the final taste and texture. It’s aged in extremely humid “affinage” (maturation) cellars to keep the cheese moist while taking on the strong, bold flavors of a cheese that’s been given time alone to age.   Not every cheese turns to a warm, decadent, ooey gooey pool of delight that you want to dive and dip into, but with Gruyère, we do get that pleasure. It takes a cheese made with rennet (as opposed to a cheese curdled with acid) to be a melting cheese, and then it takes a cheese with a high water-to-fat ratio to be a good melting cheese. Trader Joe’s Cave Aged Le Gruyère is a good melting cheese and goes wonderfully melted into sandwiches or enjoyed at room temp, solid, firm, and delicious!

sweet-plantain-chips-055085,Sweet Plantain Chips," The Quindío region of Colombia is part of the so-called “coffee triangle” (Triángulo del Café), widely considered one of the best places to grow coffee beans. It is less widely considered one of the best places to grow plantains… but this doesn’t make that fact any less true! The volcanic soil, altitude, proximity to the equatorial line, and consistent climate make this region an exceptional environment for growing this banana cultivar.   Trader Joe’s Sweet Plantain Chips start with plantains grown in this very region. Bunches are harvested by hand to reduce bruising. After harvest, the plantains are allowed extra time to ripen to a sweetness of 24 brix (natural sugar content level), as opposed to only 12 brix—a more typical number for other plantain growers. The profoundly sweet, ripe plantains are also exceedingly soft at this point—almost too soft to cut. Our Colombian supplier carefully peels each plantain by hand, and hand-feeds each one into a cutting machine to further protect the fruit. The sweet plantain slices then take a quick dip in hot sunflower oil, just until perfectly crisp.

In other words, these Blue Chips have earned their blue chip reputation.   Our supplier scours the stalk market for the finest organic, stoneground blue corn that money can buy, then adds a bit of water to it to make masa (dough). Once the masa is rolled flat and machine-cut into uniform triangles, the chips take not one, not two, but three passes through an open-flame conveyer oven. After a quick dip in the fryer and a few rolls through a giant salt tumbler, these chips are crisped & ready for whatever fixins they’re asked to face—from heaps of chunky salsa, to bowls of creamy guac, to piles of melt-y cheese, and beyond!

jicama-sticks-055482,Jicama Sticks," As with the word “quinoa,” the word “jicama” is sometimes mispronounced. It’s not kwin-Oh-ah, it’s keen- WAH. Likewise, it’s not juh-KAI-ma, it’s HICK-a-muh. Now, that we’ve got that out of the way…   Also called the “yam bean,” (much easier to pronounce), jicama is native to Central and South America. It was originally cultivated by all major Mesoamerican civilizations. This root vegetable is shaped like an overgrown flat onion. It has papery, brown skin, which hides beneath it, crisp, white flesh.   The Jicama’s bulky size and odd shape make preparing it a cumbersome ordeal. This got us thinking: What if we took care of the painful prep stage for you? We presumed that if we did, more people would become eager fans of this refreshing, underutilized vegetable. So, we did. We peeled the skin and cut the flesh into ready-to-serve sticks.   The mild, sweet-starchy flavor of jicama (sometimes described as a mix between pear flesh and potato flesh) makes the perfect blank canvas for dips—especially shaped like sticks, as these are. The wonderful crunch makes a great addition to fresh salsas and salads—just chop our sticks into smaller, bite-sized pieces. Jicama also works well cooked into stir-frys and soups.

chicken-tikka-masala-099142,Chicken Tikka Masala," First introduced to our freezers in 2009, Trader Joe’s Chicken Tikka Masala quickly became a favorite among Customers and Crew alike. What’s that? You haven’t tried it yet? Oh, boy. It’s time. This classic, Indian(ish) dish features chunks of chicken that have been roasted in an oven, or tandoor, and served in a creamy, mildly spicy, tomato-based, curry flavored sauce. A wee bit of investigation reveals that there is no standard for this iconic dish. In fact, our research found that the only thing a majority of recipes for this dish have in common is chicken. This fact rocked our culinary sensibilities, but not as much as the stories that suggest (rather convincingly) that this classic curry was created not in India, but in Great Britain. We don’t have proof, but the sources seem pretty reliable. (This explains our “ish” after “Indian.”)   Regardless of its origins, we can tell you that Trader Joe’s Chicken Tikka Masala with cumin-flavored basmati Rice is made just for us by a small, U.S.-based company that specializes in Indian-inspired foods. Rich and creamy sauce, tender chunks of white meat chicken, and nicely-flavored, cumin-infused basmati rice on the side, this frozen entrée makes a terrific lunch or dinner for one in less than five minutes in the microwave.

vegan-poke-074770,Vegan Poke," “How, exactly, has Trader Joe’s made a vegan version of a classically pescatarian dish like poke?”, you may be asking. The answer revolves around something of a textural magic trick. If you’ve never partaken of poke before, it’s a traditional Hawaiian treat made with raw, cut-up fish, marinated in a variety of sauces and seasonings. As it turns out, roasted beets have a remarkably similar texture to sashimi-grade tuna, especially when marinated in a mixture of soy sauce and sesame oil—firm, yet delicate. So, that’s how Trader Joe’s Vegan Poke evokes the tender, toothsome texture and superbly saucy flavors of poke, while still maintaining an entirely plant-based ingredient deck.   Each batch of Trader Joe’s Vegan Poke comes ready to eat, right out of the package, no heating required. In fact, we’d strongly suggest eating it chilled, as you would traditional poke. We also strongly suggest serving it over a bed of rice or mixed greens for an effortless entrée (we especially like it as a quick lunch option.) That said, it also makes a great side dish or appetizer ingredient, too—Vegan Poke nachos, anyone?

soft-juicy-mango-098741,Soft & Juicy Mango," Because we live in a world of contradictions, it’s sometimes easy to accept things that seem at odds to be simultaneously true. But still, it’s not uncommon for us to get the question, “How can mango be simultaneously soft, juicy, and dried?”   It’s a good question, and one that deserves an answer. So we’ll give it a go. This is Chokanan mango, grown in Thailand, where it is harvested at the peak of ripeness, then peeled and sliced into strips (it’s the same type of mango you’ll find in our Chile Spiced Mango). The drying process is unique in that it uses vegetable-based glycerin to keep the mango soft – but never mushy – and mango juice is added in to give it a little extra moisture and further intensify the mango flavor.   If you like the taste of mango, but find peeling a fresh mango a hassle, or you’re not a fan of the typically tougher texture of traditional dried mango, Trader Joe’s Soft & Juicy Mango is right on the money for you.  ","['Food', 'Snacks & Sweets', 'Nuts, Dried Fruits, Seeds']",https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/soft-juicy-mango-098741,$2.29,6 Oz,https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m21003/98741.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280,,"['MANGO', 'SUGAR', 'GLYCERIN', 'MANGO JUICE', 'SULPHUR DIOXIDE (ADDED FOR FRESHNESS).']",,"['Backpack Ready', 'Cheese Board', 'Finger Food', 'Midday Snacks']",['3 pieces(35g)'],['120']
gnocchi-alla-romana-074805,Gnocchi Alla Romana," In contrast to those common nugget-shaped gnocchi made from potatoes, the traditional recipe for Gnocchi alla Romana features slab-like dumplings made from semolina flour. These unique gnocchi are typically prepared like a gratin, layered in a baking dish with a cheesy sauce. In admiration of those innovators who created this Italian classic, we’ve done a little tradition-twisting of our own in the creation of Trader Joe’s Gnocchi Alla Romana.   The package includes four, drum-shaped, Cheesy Semolina Gratins made from durum wheat semolina flour, and enriched with butter, Grana Padano PDO cheese (the real deal!), and egg yolks. These relatively “giant” Gnocchi are rich and silky, with a savory seasoning of sea salt, sage, and nutmeg. Instead of appearing layered together in a baking dish, each of the four Gnocchi is cradled in its own paper cup, like a cheesy, buttery cupcake. To enjoy, one needs only to heat one or more Gnocchi in the microwave (1-4 minutes), or conventional oven (about 20 minutes).   But when to enjoy Trader Joe’s Gnocchi Alla Romana? We recommend pairing these Cheesy Semolina Gratins with a bowl of steaming soup, or a fresh green salad.

So much so, in fact, that we felt the time was right to bring in another delectable doubleheader onto our shelves. Made for us by the same supplier as the adored original, Trader Joe’s Peanut Butter Brookie takes the Brookie formula into a wonderfully nutty new direction.   To make each Peanut Butter Brookie, our supplier starts with a layer of rich, fudgy brownie batter, then tops it with a layer of sweet peanut butter cookie batter, complete with crunchy bits of chopped peanuts. After baking, they top it off with a sprinkle of sea salt to really round out that crunchy, salted peanut butter profile. With every bite, you get the classic flavor combo of chocolate and peanut butter, plus the extra dimension of a satisfyingly soft, just done cookie-brownie texture.

It’s with this pedigree in mind that we’re shining the April Spotlight on their Sweet Vanilla Cardona Cheese. Handcrafted with fresh Wisconsin goat milk sourced from local farms, aromatic vanilla bean and sweet vanilla sugar are added to the cheese when it’s removed from the brine. Over a few weeks of aging, the cheese develops notes of toasted caramel, coconut, and nutmeg, and the vanilla bean specks elegantly dot the edible rind, resulting in a fantastically fancy fromage that’s more than ready for its cheese board close-up.   This subtly sweet, delicate wedge of Cheese is a standout snack all on its own, but to further elevate its toasty vanilla notes, cut it into cubes and serve with a dollop of Fresh Strawberry Preserves; pairing it with the bursting berry flavors and toasted oak notes from a  glass of magnetic Merlot will have the same scrumptious effect.

buffalo-style-chickenless-wings-075295,Buffalo Style Chickenless Wings," Since their invention nearly sixty years ago, Buffalo wings have soared to auspicious heights within the world of appetizers—it’s difficult to imagine what modern American bar food would look like without them. In fact, they’re so beloved, that plant-based variations have been in high demand for nearly as long as their chicken- based counterparts. And while we’ve enjoyed many a Buffalo cauliflower floret over the years, they’ve always felt different than a traditional Buffalo wing—delicious, of course, but in a distinctly different category. With this in mind, we recently reached out to one of our suppliers, an expert in plant-based proteins, and gave them this challenge: a vegan, Buffalo-style appetizer that truly captures the feeling of a crisp, fresh-from-the-fryer Buffalo wing. They proudly came back with Trader Joe’s Buffalo Style Chickenless Wings.   Made with a mix of soy and pea protein, these vegan Wings have a remarkably meaty texture that’s crisp on the outside and satisfying juicy on the inside. They only take a few minutes to prep in the air fryer (or a little bit longer in the oven), and each bag comes with a packet of also-vegan, Buffalo-Style hot sauce to give each Wing that classic, cayenne kick to every bite. We recommend them as an appetizer or snack when you’ve got folks over to watch a game or movie, as a companion to our Vegan Meatless Meat Eater’s Pizza, or as the center of a spicy, Chickenless sandwich layered with shredded lettuce and pickles.

The pickle-flavored Pups are then coated in a mixure of batter and breadcrumbs that’s seasoned with even more particularly pickley ingredients.

The result is a combo of red, white, and green Gnocchi in each pack—the colors on the Italian flag.   In addition to the unique chromatic characteristics of these Gnocchi, they’re also magnificently Mini-sized in comparison to most of the gnocchi you’ll find in our stores, which means they cook up in just a couple of minutes.

Before you say, “Duh, Trader Joe’s,” allow us to explain…   All of our Organic Peanut Butters are made with Valencia peanuts, grown only in Texas and New Mexico. In contrast, most commercial peanut butters are made from Runner peanuts. Runners are widely cultivated and have a high yield, but they’re just not as good tasting as Valencias. That’s because Valencias are naturally sweet with an intense peanut flavor—eliminating the need to add any kind of sweeteners or flavor enhancers. Valen- cias are so good, we use only two ingredients to make our Organic Creamy Salted Valencia Peanut Butter... You guessed it: peanuts and salt. Really, we think once you taste ours, you’ll wonder how you ever got through this much of your life without it.   (A note to “natural” peanut butter newbies: We don’t use hydrogenated oils to solidify the peanut butter, so the natural oils will rise to the top of the jar. To easily blend your butter together, store a new jar in your fridge upside down. When you’re ready to start enjoying it, turn it right side up, give it a quick stir and dig in!)

aioli-garlic-mustard-sauce-027677,Aioli Garlic Mustard Sauce," Trader Joe’s Aioli Garlic Mustard Sauce takes the very idea of mustard and stands it on its head, throws it for a loop, and flies it in the face of expectation. Literally translated to “Garlic” (ai) and “oil” (oli), Aioli is what gives this creative condiment its cachet. With a base of not-too-pungent mustard, the mixture of garlic, oil, and egg contribute a smooth, mellow, garlicky creaminess that makes this mustard unique among its peers. The Mustard flavor shines through, with a garlicky accent that improves everything it touches. Dipping sauce for fries? Check. Spread for a burger or hot dog bun? Check.

green-tea-unsweetened-beverage-046769,Green Tea Unsweetened Beverage," Did you know? Both green and black tea are made with leaves that come from the same species of plant­, Camellia sinensis. The difference in color and flavor between the two is due to the fact that black tea leaves undergo a withering (accelerated drying) and oxidation (curing in a climate-controlled room) process, whereas green tea leaves do not. Hence, green teas, like our Trader Joe’s Unsweetened Green Tea Beverage, have a fresher, more floral, more delicately grassy flavor. And it’s exactly that flavor profile that makes our pre-brewed. ready-to-drink Unsweetend Green Tea Beverage so remarkably refreshing. Equally delicious whether its served hot or chilled, it can be customized with slices of your favorite citrus, muddled with a sprig of mint, or even incorporated into an alluringly aromatic cocktail. We find that its fine, earthy notes are particularly well suited for serving alongside savory pastries, fresh cut melon, and seafood of all kinds.

For us, this brilliant idea that sprung forth resulted in Trader Joe’s Vegetable Spring Rolls.   Named after the Spring Festival in China, where spring rolls are served, these are no ordinary Spring Rolls. While we’ve kept many of the elements found in traditional spring rolls, like cabbage, onion, and carrots, we’ve also cooked up some delightful updates. Kale, shredded tofu, and edamame add fresh and vibrant flavors to our rolls. All of these ingredients, along with mushrooms, ginger, and garlic, are put through a centrifuge to remove excess moisture and provide a crispier final product. Then this filling is rolled into a thin pastry wrapper and fried before frozen. Prepare according to the package directions and you’ll have perfectly crispy, tasty Spring Rolls—as if they were never frozen!   The best part about our Vegetable Spring Rolls (besides their tastiness, of course)…? You can eat them year round! Cut rolls in half and serve at a cocktail party with Sweet Chili Sauce.

italian-bigonda-cheese-with-herbs-058088,Italian Bigonda Cheese with Herbs," The Dolomite mountain range of Italy is a renowned destination for skiers, cyclists and even stair climbers – it’s home to the Calà del Sasso, the world’s longest staircase open to the public at 4,444 steps. The Dolomite mountain range is also renowned for its cheeses, and happens to be the home of Trader Joe’s Italian Bigonda Cheese with Herbs. Our Bigonda Cheese is made for us by a master cheese-making family in the Trentino province, with over 80 years of experience under their belts. The milk used in the making of this cheese comes from cattle that graze on the breathtaking mountain pastures of the Dolomites. The clean air and lush mountain grasses help the cows produce supremely fresh milk, ideal for making this traditional style of Italian farmstead cheese, known as caciotta, that has a semi-soft texture with a creamy, firm consistency. While there are variations on the style (some cheese makers add black pepper or olive oil), our Bigonda Cheese is studded with laurel, thyme, parsley, organic chives, fennel and caraway seeds, juxtaposing fragrant Herbs with the slightly sweet, fresh milk notes of the cheese.  The beauty of Bigonda is its versatility – you can melt it into an omelet or on a grilled cheese sandwich, or try it cut into cubes atop a green salad with extra virgin olive oil, garbanzo beans and thinly sliced red onion. Liven up a cheese plate with sliced Bigonda and a foil of sweet fig jam, crunchy Marcona almonds and crisp white wine.

It replaces the typical two-step shampoo and conditioner hair-care ritual with one product that simultaneously cleans and conditions, leaving your hair soft and shiny!   Many shampoos contain detergents that strip hair of its natural oils, which often leads to dry strands and itchy scalps. Our Hair Wash doesn’t contain any detergents, sulfates, parabens, or silicone—so you’re left with clean hair, minus the harsh side effects that result from shampoo overuse. Products like this one are often referred to as “co-washes”—conditioners that are used to both wash and condition hair—and they’re becoming a popular alternative for good reason. By co-washing, your hair won’t need to be washed as frequently. It will hydrate dry hair and help tame frizz while enhancing texture and adding volume.   To use our Cleansing & Conditioning Hair Wash, simply wet your hair and apply it to your hair and scalp. It won’t foam up like typical shampoos (that’s what detergents do); it will feel more like a creamy conditioner. Enjoy the invigorating grapefruit and minty scent while you massage it into your hair and scalp then rinse thoroughly.

You see, in colloquial Mexican Spanish, the prefix re is often used to mean “very.” So frijoles refritos should actually translate to very fried beans, not refried beans. Interesting, right?   And accurate, it turns out. To make really good refried beans, you have to cook them for hours. But with Trader Joe’s Traditional Style Fat Free Refried Beans, you can get that same great taste by simply opening a can, because all that work has already been done.

sliced-sharp-cheddar-cheese-077728,Sliced Sharp Cheddar Cheese," What’s the best thing since sliced bread? Sliced cheese, of course. Sliced cheese like Trader Joe’s Sliced Sharp Cheddar.   Trader Joe’s Sliced Sharp Cheddar is made for us under the supervision of two Wisconsin Master Cheesemakers, using milk from local family farms. It’s a traditional Cheddar, made using the time-honored “cheddaring” process first employed in the English village of Cheddar (yes, there is such a place, in Somerset). Traditional cheddaring involves putting the cheese curds through a mill after they’ve been cut and turned. It’s a time and labor intensive process that yields a significantly more complex cheese than you get from more “modern” cheddaring methods like stirring the curds.   The flavor and texture of Cheddar changes dramatically as it ages, to our eternal delight.

We think the Hearts of Palm Pasta on our grocery shelves is a pretty impressive pasta substitute, so we set out to discover if it could be a suitable stand-in for another beloved grain, rice—and dazzle us, it did! For a simple, versatile, and convenient replacement for rice, Trader Joe’s Riced Hearts of Palm is just hearts of palm, that has been… well… riced. It’s gluten free, vegan, and kosher, too.   Tender, mild-tasting, hearts of palm come from the center of palm trees. Our Ecuadorian supplier takes the harvested Hearts and processes them, so it comes out looking like rice. Nothing is added to this mild- flavored Rice, so you can use as a blank canvas for a variety of dishes and flavors. Make a grain-free grain bowl, by adding sautéed veggies, a protein (maybe tofu or chicken) to the prepared Rice, and dress it with Green Goddess Salad Dressing. Since our Riced Hearts of Palm takes five minutes or less to prepare on the stove or in the microwave, so you can have a homemade fried rice ready in under 20 minutes.

It’s crafted with a suite of spices and seasonings including granulated garlic, cayenne pepper, vinegar powder, sugar, and kosher salt, which all combine to add a uniquely Sriracha-y note to any dish you wish. And since it’s in a dry seasoning, it’s all the more convenient to add to foods that don’t mix quite as well with sauces, like pop corn or freshly roasted veggies.   Looking to add an extra savory something and a hit of heat to your next dry rub? Sriracha Sprinkle will make an idispensable addition. Need a little extra oomph in your burgers, egg salad, or breading for fried chicken? Sriracha Sprinkle is a top pick for picnics.

Vastly versatile and proudly unpretentious, we’re so inspired by ketchup’s ample applicability that we couldn’t help but wonder if there was a way to take it even further. And so we asked ourselves: what would an even more convenient ketchup look like? What if it could be administered evenly over roasted veggies with getting messy, tossed with warm french fries without getting them soggy, or easily included in dry rubs and salt blends? The answer, we found, was Trader Joe’s Ketchup Flavored Sprinkle.   Made with a base of tomato powder, kosher salt, and sugar, this terrifically tomato-y Seasoning Blend brings the bright, sweet, and ever-so-slightly umami flavor of Ketchup to anything you can Sprinkle it over. Just like its namesake inspiration, it adds a delightful zing of flavor to all kinds of snacks, like our Waffle Cut Fries or Sweet Potato Frites.

strawberries-cream-gelato-075375,Strawberries & Cream Gelato," In Italian, “gelato” is the word for “ice cream” in general. Most Italian ice cream, however, is made in a certain style—so when stateside treat-seekers are referring to gelato, they are typically talking about an Italian-style ice cream. An ice cream that’s intensely creamy, yet surprisingly refreshing. An ice cream that’s wondrously light, yet velvety and dense. An ice cream like Trader Joe’s Strawberries & Cream Gelato.   Like all the greatest gelato, TJ’s Strawberries & Cream Gelato is made (in Italy!) with more milk than cream, whereas American-style ice cream is typically made with more cream than milk. This lower butterfat content gives the Gelato a light, refreshing quality and allows its bright Strawberries & Cream flavor — courtesy of strawberry purée, candied strawberry pieces, and actual vanilla bean specks — to really shine through. And while you might assume that less butterfat would yield a less creamy result… you’d be wrong if you did. Per the Italian tradition (did we mention it’s made in Italy?), this Gelato also holds less air than American-style ice cream, so it still offers that smooth, creamy mouthfeel you crave.

It’s simple to prepare – 20 minutes or so on your stovetop or in a rice cooker yields soft, fluffy, full-flavored rice.

All Extra Virgin Olive Oil is categorized as “cold pressed” because no high heat (at levels that could degrade the oil) or chemicals are used to extract the juice. In addition, the juice must meet certain levels in laboratory tasting for things like levels of peroxide and acidity. Extra Virgin Olive Oil must have no more than 0.8% acidity.

But since good candy is so often characterized by excess, you may wonder why we would choose moderation when creating this nutty, chocolatey treat. The answer is... you. More and more customers have been asking for less and less—when it comes to sugar content, and other nutritional aspects considered by some to be less than desirable. And so, we decided to create some Dark Chocolate Covered Almonds with notably less of the less desirable stuff—while still providing a really significant snacking experience. To a substantial degree, we believe we’ve succeeded!   Our supplier dry-roasts California Almonds, then pans them (tumbles them in a barrel with chocolate), and finishes them with a dusting of cocoa powder and sea salt. The chocolate-to-nut ratio ends up being about 20/80. (Typically, chocolate covered nuts are around 66/33.)

Case in point: Wildfire Blue. Made by the expert cheesemaking team at Carr Valley Cheese, this Wisconsin blue starts with a classically creamy, perfectly salty, remarkably expressive blue cheese profile, complete with rich blue veins streaked throughout. They then take things to the next level with the addition of pepperoncini pepper flakes, turning the cheese into a masterclass in multi- faceted flavors. Each soft, melt-in-your-mouth bite becomes a marvelous mix of creaminess, fiery heat, and ripe blue notes of salted caramel—in other words, a combination that will light up your senses like wildfire.   So, what to do with a spicy blue? Aside from simply enjoying it on its own or as part of a cheese plate (an excellent option, especially when drizzled with your favorite honey, we might add), Wildfire Blue’s unique spicy-sweet-salty profile makes it a great addition to most savory fare. Try adding a few crumbles to the top of a freshly grilled burger or steak, or mixing into a batch of macaroni and cheese, for starters—speaking of starters, how about a Wildfire Blue-stuffed jalapeño popper?

roasted-garlic-pesto-pizza-with-deep-fried-crust-068834,Roasted Garlic & Pesto Pizza with Deep Fried Crust," In Naples, Italy, pizza fritta is an ubiquitous street food. Pizza fritta translates directly to “fried pizza,” so its popularity isn’t hard to understand. Pizza = delicious. Fried food = delicious. Fried pizza? Doubly delicious! It comes in many forms in the streets of Naples, and, now, in the frozen aisles of your local Trader Joe’s, it comes in the form of Trader Joe’s Roasted Garlic & Pesto Pizza with Deep Fried Crust.   Our Roasted Garlic & Pesto Pizza is made for us authentically in Naples, where our supplier takes great care in replicating the lengthy, artisanal process of this particular pizza-making method. The dough is matured for 90 hours, then fermented for 6 additional hours, and while its fermenting, they manually fold the dough three times a day. Once the dough reaches peak readiness, our supplier shapes it by hand and deep fries it in sunflower seed oil for a quick three minutes. The result is a crust that is at once perfectly crunchy and dreamily airy, chewy, and pillowy.   The toppings are just as key as the crust, and we didn’t skimp there, either—our Product Developer based the recipe on one of the best pizzas she’s ever had, which came from a teeny-tiny little pizzeria in Bari, Italy. Accordingly, we top each Deep Fried Crust with mozzarella, provolone, Parmigiano Reggiano, and—most importantly—dollops of burrata and fresh pesto with roasted garlic.

That’s because vine vigor can be completely controlled through irrigation from the nearby Columbia River, and Trader Joe’s Reserve Wahluke Slope Syrah benefits big-time from the irrigation implementation specific to this AVA.    Blended from 96% organic Syrah and 4% Merlot, these grapes were grown in the region’s fertile, loamy soil. They yield a ruby-red juice that is sumptuous with bright, fresh herbs, and blue-fruit flavors. The discerning drinker might also detect notes of barrel spices, olives, coffee, and firewood. Ultimately, it’s an elegant and very drinkable wine.    A glass of this Syrah loves some grilled chicken as an accompaniment. And Calabrian Chili Spicy Pasta Sauce mingled with our Pappardelle is likewise, a suitable partner.

Divided by the volcanic Barisan mountain range that is greater than 12,400 feet at its peak, the topography and humid climate are well suited for coffee cultivation.   Small family farmers grow the 100% Arabica beans for Trader Joe’s Fair Trade Organic Sumatra Coffee among fruit trees in the northern region of the island. The beans are picked, washed, and pulped by hand, using the distinctive “wet-hulling” process. This unique production method, known in Indonesia as Giling Basah, contributes to the signature characteristics of Sumatra coffee: full bodied, lower acidity, and bold, earthy flavors. The beans are given a medium-dark roast to accentuate tasting notes of dried fruit and molasses in every sip.   Not only can a cup of Trader Joe’s Fair Trade Organic Sumatra positively impact the start of your day, because of it’s Fair Trade certification, each bag supports small farmers through fair prices. So, go ahead, brew yourself a mug—it works exceptionally well with drip, pour over, French press, and espresso brewing methods.

zamora-ecuador-small-lot-coffee-074173,Zamora Ecuador Small Lot Coffee," Located on the southeastern edge of Ecuador, at the very edge of the Amazon Basin, the province of Zamora Chinchipe is famed for its awe-inspiring natural beauty. Tourists from all around the globe come to experience its enchanting flora, unique fauna, and utterly majestic waterfalls, flowing freely from the Andean highlands. Up in those mountains, one can also find communities of coffee growers, utilizing the region’s high elevations and tropical climate to cultivate lush, full-flavored coffee beans—just like what you’ll find in every bag of Trader Joe’s Zamora Ecuador Small Lot Coffee.   Hand-picked, sun-dried, and medium roasted, these Zamora Ecuador beans brew into a fantastically full- bodied coffee, replete with notes of warm molasses, rich dark chocolate, and nimbly spicy nutmeg. This bold flavor profile, combined with a relatively low level of acidity, makes it an able companion to all kinds of breakfast and brunch fare, like cheesy, herby omelettes, saucy huevos rancheros, and well-dressed avocado toasts. For a special treat, we recommend pairing it up with something sweet that has a slightly savory edge to interact with the darker flavors in each sip—our Sea Salt Brownie Bites, for example, will do wonderfully.

Why, it’s new Trader Joe’s Chhurpi Puffs Dog Treats, which, according to some of our favorite dogs (okay, fine, our dogs), might just be our best Dog Treats to date! But just what is chhurpi? Glad you asked…   Chhurpi, or durkha, is an extremely hard cheese native to the Himalayas, traditionally made from Yak’s milk or buttermilk (ours is made from a blend of both). The milk gets boiled, then the curds are wrapped in a thin cloth and hung out to dry for several days. Once the cheese is quite firm, it’s sliced into strips or cubes and dried over a fire or in an oven on low heat.   At this point in the process, Chhurpi makes an excellent human snack, but to make its texture extra dog- friendly, our Nepalese supplier takes it a step further by microwaving the chhurpi nuggets. This forces the cheese to “puff ” — kind of like microwave popcorn — and turns it into crunchy, savory treats your pup will be begging for!

It’s a shared moment in every sense of the word: you’re sharing time and space in addition to sharing nourishment. So when we find a food that brings the idea of sharing to the fore, as our tear- and-share Cheddar Jalapeño Pull Apart Bread does, it holds a special place in our hearts. Call us romantics if you must—just don’t call us late to the dinner table.   To make Trader Joe’s Cheddar Jalapeño Pull Apart Bread, our supplier makes a fluffy, airy, almost focaccia-like dough, sprinkles it generously with shredded cheddar and sliced jalapeño peppers, then chops it into roll-sized pieces. After that, they cobble the pieces together in a tray and bake them just enough for you to finish the job at home. Out of your oven, the bread becomes delightfully warm, the cheese wonderfully gooey, and the jalapeños satisfyingly crisp. From there, you and anyone else you’re sharing a meal with are free to pull the pieces apart and enjoy—together. It makes an excellent appetizer option, especially when combined with a fun dipping sauce like our Organic Ranch Dressing, and a delightfully spicy dinner roll option, too.

It begins with a mixed veggie base that includes chopped green & red cabbage, green leaf lettuce, carrots, kale, green onion, and of course, crispy, dried, sweet corn kernels. We add cornbread crumbles, seasoned with smoked paprika, to add even more crunch and a little bit of heat; crumbled cotija cheese delivers creamy flavor and adds a soft texture to the mix. The real magic here lies in the creamy, elote-inspired dressing that’s a little tart and a little sweet, with hints of jalapeño and lime. Tossed together, you won’t think you’re eating elote from a street vendor, but you will feel that same energy in every forkful of greens. Add your favorite protein (we like chicken or shrimp) and a sliced avocado to make this a complete meal. Grab a corn tortilla and heat it ever so slightly, then fill it with this satisfying mix—a taco to remember, for sure!

cape-gooseberries-091624,Cape Gooseberries," Cape Gooseberries (aka “Golden Berries”) are the very definition of superfruit. Their size and shape make one think first of cherry tomatoes. Their orange-golden color suggests some relation to persimmons or citrus. And then there are the dried green leaves that enclose each Gooseberry, like a tomatillo—or a superhero’s cape, fittingly enough. So what exactly is a Cape Gooseberry?!   Ours are grown in South America, from whence Gooseberries are native, and where they’ve been grown since the days of the Incan empire. Slice into one and you’ll find moist seeds suspended like the inside a tomato or tomatillo—though more plentiful. (Incidentally, these Berries arrive in our stores with the tomatillo-like leaves removed.) Take a taste and you’ll discover they’re juicy and quite tart, reminiscent of sour candy, but still including hints of sweet, tropical-fruit flavor.    Nutritionally, Cape Gooseberries have an impressive amount of antioxidants, along with plenty of fiber, vitamin C, and other important vitamins and minerals. With their earned “superfood” status, Gooseberries make an obvious choice for adding to smoothies. Their tart character makes them ideal for simmering with sugar to create pie filling or jams. Of course, you can also enjoy them raw, right out of the package, or sliced and tossed in a salad!

sumo-citrus-mandarins-074863,Sumo Citrus® Mandarins," Originally cultivated in Japan in the 1970s, the first Sumo Citrus® was crossbred by growers who sought to combine the easy-peel nature of a satsuma, the considerable size of a standard orange, and the enticing sweetness of a mandarin, all into one seriously scrumptious super-fruit. In the years since, the dekopon, as it’s known in its home country, has become a global sensation, beloved for its sweet, almost candy-like flavor, charmingly craggy skin, and signature, top knot-like bump. The ones you’ll find at Trader Joe’s are grown in California’s San Joaquin Valley, where the climate is ideal for producing these fabulously flavorful Citrus.   On picking up a Sumo Citrus®, you’ll likely be struck by the bumpy texture of its soft, loose-fitting peel. After removing the peel, you’ll then likely be struck by the ease with which its thin-membraned, seedless segments come apart. And on first bite, you’ll most certainly be struck by its marvelous sweetness and profound juiciness. We recommend these for all kinds of snacking occasions, from mid-commute pick-me-up, a school lunch sweet-treat, or handheld refreshment on a weekend hike.

What else can we say about a tradition that directly correlates affection with confections? In fact, just in time for Valentine’s, we’re introducing Trader Joe’s Dark Chocolate Caramel Hearts, a sweet treat that makes that correlation manifest. Made with chewy, buttery-sweet Caramel enrobed in a shell of brightly polished Dark Chocolate, these handsomely Heart-shaped candies are a decidedly delicious way to celebrate love, friendship, and appreciation, in all their forms.   Trader Joe’s Dark Chocolate Caramel Hearts are great for gifting to a loved one as part of a Valentine’s present, an excellent garnish for a festive dessert or chocolate charcuterie board, a superb sweet snack if you just happen to be in the mood for Caramel and Dark Chocolate (and why wouldn’t you be?). For an extra elevated experience, we recommend pairing a few Hearts with a cup of smooth, easy-drinking coffee, like our Joe Medium Roast Ground Coffee.

(Brix is a unit used for measuring sweetness.) Our supplier takes these naturally sugary mangoes and washes, peels, and slices them by hand before placing the thin, orange slabs on drying racks.

We can personally vouch for the dreamy flavor of a creamy cheese and rich cocoa concoction—but why just take our word for it when you can just buy a tub of our Hot Cocoa Inspired Cream Cheese Spread and taste what we mean?!   What appears as an unassuming eight-ounce container of cream cheese, is actually a novel schmear with a recipe that’s unique to Trader Joe’s. The cheese base, made from pasteurized milk and cream, is blended with cocoa until it’s smooth and spreadable. These flavors are sweetened with sugar, and balanced with a touch of salt. A hint of natural vanilla flavor conjures marshmallows in your palate’s imagination, bringing this Cream Cheese Spread fully into the Hot Cocoa flavor realm!   Bagels are always a top cream-cheese complement, and this instance is no exception. We might add that the Hot Cocoa flavor is especially nice smeared on freshly baked Mini Croissants. Try spreading some on a Cinnamon Graham Cracker that you top with a Dark Chocolate Covered Marshmallow. For a different spin, put some on slices of your favorite apple, bringing the taste of tart-sweet fruit to the Hot-Cocoa-Cream-Cheese table!

kung-pao-chicken-097706,Kung Pao Chicken," Trader Joe’s Kung Pao Chicken combines dark meat chicken with crunchy green & red bell peppers, onions, dried chili powder, water chestnuts and peanuts. What makes this Kung Pao so distinctive, though, is the sauce. Traditionally, sauces for this dish are rich and savory and can range from mildly spicy to sound-the-alarm-and-grab-a-hose hot. Ours falls in the medium-spicy range—the dish will taste substantially hotter if you actually eat the chili pieces, and a little less hot if you push the chilies to the side of the plate and treat them as a garnish. We think the heat level in our sauce makes it easy to share among friends who fall on opposite sides of the spicy spectrum. If really spicy is your thing, though, you can always add your favorite spicy condiment and even more chili peppers to the finished dish.   We recommend preparing our Kung Pao Chicken on the stovetop, in a really hot wok or skillet, but it can also be prepared in the microwave. Serve it with one of our frozen, ready-in-three-minutes rice options or our Organic Riced Cauliflower, and you’ll have a complete meal ready in ten minutes or less.

Unlike other, overly sweet cocoa mixes we’ve encountered, Trader Joe’s Organic Hot Cocoa Mix strikes a careful balance between sweet and chocolatey, and carries it all with a delectably smooth mouthfeel. It’s made with all-organic ingredients, and includes dried organic milk, so that all that’s needed on your end is hot water. We find that the best water-to-mix ratio for a full-flavored cup of Cocoa is eight ounces hot water per one envelope of Mix, and we especially like it when it’s topped with a handful of TJ's Mini Marshmallows or a dollop of whipped cream.

organic-trofie-pasta-074213,Organic Trofie Pasta," Sometimes, one can only be satiated by a bowl of really good pasta. Trader Joe’s Organic Trofie Pasta is one such majestic macaroni. What makes this noodle noteworthy? It starts with the Italian pasta maker sourcing high quality, organic, and local durum wheat semolina, then going the extra mile to mill the flour themselves. High quality tools are equally essential—bronze-coated shaping disks are used to produce thick, textured noodles that deliver a perfectly al dente texture, crucial to support the heftiness of your sauce while maintaining a delicate chew.   The Trofie pasta shape originates from Liguria, the northwest coastal region of Italy, famous for pesto. You could say pesto is Trofie’s soul-sauce, a match made in pasta-eating heaven. But limiting Trofie to a single sauce would be a mistake. These short, twisted noodles pair well with a variety of sauces, in both hot and cold applications.

traditional-whole-milk-ricotta-cheese-050920,Traditional Whole Milk Ricotta Cheese," “Ricotta” is an old Italian word literally meaning “recooked” which is a tell-tale, practical naming, telling you exactly how this fluffy, sweet cheese is produced. Cheesemakers simply take the whey left from whipping up batches of other types of cheese, drizzle in whole milk, an acid of some sort (in our case, acetic acid), and begin cooking the whey mixture. This causes curds to coagulate, grow, and solidify. Finally, the curds are strained of the remaining whey and you’re left with freshly made, fluffy, white Whole Milk Ricotta Cheese.   The aforementioned process is the “traditional” way (or should we say whey) of making ricotta, and as we’re never one to shy away from culinary tradition, Trader Joe’s Ricotta Cheese follows this authentic tradition to bring our shoppers a classically Italian cheese able to find its way into tons of recipes! An ideal cheese for lasagna, baked pastas, stuffed shells, and of course dessert recipes such as cannolis and cheese blintzes. In addition to all these mealtime options, our Whole Milk Ricotta Cheese is high in calcium and, for a cheese, light in fat and high in protein.

Next the Turkey is slow smoked over applewood and other hardwoods for several hours. Then it’s sliced and packaged and, voilà! Bacon. And just like pork bacon, you can cook it in a skillet, in the oven, or in the microwave.   Unlike pork bacon, our Uncured Turkey Bacon is 94% fat free!

One of our suppliers, who specialized in cauliflower-based cuisine, came to us with a problem: they often found themselves with a lot of stems and florets that weren’t quite big enough to fit into one of their frozen cauliflower dishes and didn’t want to let them go to waste. We put our heads together and found that by grating these leftovers into bits, it made a rather delicious alternative to rice. How’s that for a win-win?   Years later, our Organic Riced Cauliflower is still very much a winning proposal. As versatile as it is delectable, it makes a great base for a rice bowl when topped with curry or Kung Pao Chicken, a phenomenal filling for tacos or burritos when mixed with a bit of cilantro, and an awesome ingredient for a rustic, low-carb risotto when sautéed with onions, white wine, and a bit of parmesan cheese and butter.

butter-chicken-with-basmati-rice-099032,Butter Chicken with Basmati Rice," #Cookinghacks – that’s how the original recipe for butter chicken is said to have been created. Chef Kundan Lal Gujral was basically playing with a tandoor, a clay oven that conducts super high heat. Primarily used for baking bread, he was testing out how it might treat chicken. So, he would coat chicken pieces with yogurt, skewer them and place them in the tandoor...Tandoori Chicken came to be. Butter, here is where it gets better. To avoid letting leftover tandoori chicken get dry, he crafted a rich, silky (thank you, butter) tomato- and onion-based sauce with which he could enliven the meat, and thus was born the beloved Butter Chicken.   Trader Joe’s Butter Chicken with Basmati Rice is the ultimate #Cookinghacks for this dish.

chili-lime-flavored-rolled-corn-tortilla-chips-061420,Chili & Lime Flavored Rolled Corn Tortilla Chips," Trader Joe's Chili & Lime Flavored Rolled Corn Tortilla Chips are spicy, ire-zest-tible little scrolls made from stone ground corn masa. Compared to similar snacks available elsewhere, these gluten free Chips are cut & rolled a little thicker for additional crunch. They're also crispier, since we've reduced the amount of water in them before they hit the fryer.   Paired with this captivating crunchiness is a generous dusting of hot Chili & Lime Flavored seasoning. This makes for a tastefully tangy, definitely spicy profile-though we didn't get too silly with the chili, so you'll keep coming back to the bag for another handful. (We should also mention that the vibrant orange hue is naturally derived from vegetable juice, and paprika and turmeric extracts-another trait that sets this snack apart!)   While our Rolled Corn Tortilla Chips are super satisfying as a stand-alone snack, they are also the ideal shape for dipping in Trader Joe's Avocado's Number Guacamole, or Roasted Garlic Hummus-if you feel the need to invite garlic to the flavor-party.

pizza-sprinkle-seasoning-blend-074734,Pizza Sprinkle Seasoning Blend," Pizza is one of those rare foods that varies widely in expression from region to region (or even just kitchen to kitchen), yet still has a more or less universally accepted “taste”—in this case, we’re talking about that savory, garlicky, tomato-y flavor that immediately brings a fresh-from-the-oven pizza pie to mind. As both purveyors and avid appreciators of pizza ourselves, we got to thinking: wouldn’t it be great if we could add those zesty, herb-y, unmistakeably pizza-y notes to all kinds of other foods, too? That’s when we created Trader Joe’s Pizza Sprinkle, a Seasoning Blend that provides the power of pizza in a conveniently Sprinkle-able form.   What’s the secret? Our supplier makes each batch with a base of tomato powder and granulated garlic to evoke the flavor of tomato sauce, then finishes it with a suite of complementary herbs and spices like oregano, basil, and paprika to evoke a wide range of classic toppings. We recommend shaking it over hot french fries, roasted cauliflower, scrambled eggs, and creamy soups. Looking to bring a little pizza pizazz to your favorite snacks? This Sprinkle goes great over popcorn, mini pretzels, and even our very own Saddle Chips. No idea is too pie-in-the-sky when you’ve got Trader Joe’s Pizza Sprinkle by your side!

But before you throw that bouquet into a crowd at the checkout line, this Soup doesn’t actually have anything to do with weddings. In Italian, Wedding Soup is called “minestra maritata,” meaning marriage soup, referring to the way the flavors of the meat and vegetables harmoniously meld together, not because it’s served at Italian weddings. Though, if we were throwing a wedding at Trader Joe’s, we’d be happy to be served this soup.   Our version has a flavorful chicken broth, with rich, beef meatballs, and a garden-worth of veggies, like kale, carrots, and onions. The flavor is intensified with Parmesan cheese, and for an extra dose of comfort, little pearls of pasta, called acini di pepe, in every bite—sounds worthy of a celebration to us! All you have to do is heat it up. We recommend serving it with a toasted Ciabatta Baguette.

ubriaco-al-cabernet-075406,Ubriaco al Cabernet," Wine and cheese go together like bread and butter—for some, they’re effectively inseperable. And in our latest Spotlight Cheese, they go together so well that they’re actually quite literally inseperable! A treasured tradition of the Treviso region of Italy, Trader Joe’s Ubriaco al Cabernet is made by taking wheels of delicately sweet and creamy cheese, poking them all over with a series of holes, then aging them in a mixture of dry Cabernet wine and grape marc (the mashed grape skins that are left over during the winemaking process) for at least eight months. As the cheese ages and develops a robust flavor and firm texture, the holes in the cheese soak in the wine and mashed grape juices, turning the rind a rich, burgundy red.   This process, playfully referred to as “inebriating” the cheese (Ubriaco itself is Italian for “drunk” or “tipsy”) also infuses the entire wheel with persistently ripe, fruity, and lightly spicy Cabernet notes, giving every bite an expansive suite of flavors that’s a bit like enjoying a fine wine and fine cheese at the same time. That makes it an especially apt choice for inclusion in all kinds of charcuteries and cheese plates, especially when paired with a bottle of your favorite dry red wine.

A traditional ingredient in Japanese cuisine for more than a thousand years, it’s making a highly anticipated debut to our grocery shelves. Trader Joe’s White Miso Paste is made of fermented rice and soybeans, and like many fantastic, fermented foods, it has a complex flavor—a mix of savory, salty, and umami. Our supplier is a 5th generation miso maker in Japan. Their process involves a shorter-than-standard fermentation period to yield a delicate, umami flavor, making this a very versatile Miso.   Most commonly used in savory preparations, White Miso adds depth to soups, sauces, and dressings. You can use it in marinades for meats, fish, and tofu, or as a dip for crudité. Because of its short ferment, it adds balance and pleasant dimension to baked goods, without making them too salty or savory. Miso chocolate chip cookies, anyone? Best yet, since we’ve suggested such a variety of ways to use this White Miso Paste—a little here, a little there—it comes in a handy, resealable pouch to help keep it fresher longer.

And because it’s easy to prepare, we think it will solve your “what’s for breakfast and lunch?” quandary, too.

They’re made for us by a supplier in Italy, who slices cobs of corn into quarters and then lightly cooks them until they naturally take on a slightly curved, barbecued rib-like shape. After that, they season them with salt and an olive oil and cocoa butter-based vegan butter, before flash freezing them and sending them our way. They can be prepared in a manner of minutes in your microwave, or a little longer in the oven or air fryer, and make a fantastic plant-based side for all kinds of fare, barbecue or otherwise.

We immediately set to work with one of our Italian pasta suppliers to remedy this omission, and to say we were thrilled with what they came back with would be a tremendous understatement. Made with delicately thin pasta, wrapped around a luxuriously creamy filling comprised of four Italian cheeses, Trader Joe’s 4 Cheese Ravioli have a mild, savory flavor, a satisfyingly tender texture, and, simply put, one of the best filling-to-pasta ratios we’ve ever encountered.   Like our other fresh ravioli options, Trader Joe’s 4 Cheese Ravioli make a practically effortless entrée: after just a few minutes in salted, boiling water, they’re ready to be drained and dressed with whatever sauces or toppings you prefer. We find that their cheesy flavor profile lends itself well to pairing with our Creamy Tomato Basil Pasta Sauce, or even something as simple as a quick drizzle of olive oil, and bit of shaved Parmesan, and a few shakes of crushed red pepper.

It has a refreshing, gingery bite, and mild carbonation. The addition of lemon and lime juices adds a zesty, citrus zing, and also helps establish the right acidic balance. After canning, our Brewed Ginger Beer is pasteurized, which gives it shelf stability.   We think our Ginger Beer makes the perfect refresher, all by itself—chilled, or over ice. But, there’s also no denying it enhances the character of spirits. Enjoy a Bermudan classic, the Dark & Stormy, made with dark rum and Ginger Beer. Or, imbibe a customized Mule cocktail: in a copper mug (if you’ve got it), mix our Brewed Ginger Beer with lime juice and your favorite vodka, tequila, whiskey, or gin.

organic-apricot-preserves-075418,Organic Apricot Preserves," Did you know? Apricots, along with apples, raspberries, cherries, and almonds, belong to the Rosaceae family of plants, meaning they share a common botanical ancestor with roses. That might partially explain why the members of our tasting panel were so utterly swept off their feet when they tried our Organic Apricot Preserves. Made with organic apricots and organic cane sugar, these Preserves couple the uniquely sweet and delicately tart flavor of its star stonefruit with a charmingly chunky texture that’s ideal for spreading over toast, muffins, or freshly made pancakes. Altogether, it’s a jam that’s so joyfully juicy that it might just make you see the world through apricot-colored glasses.   An able companion for all kinds of breakfast-y baked goods, Trader Joe’s Organic Apricot Preserves also serve splendidly in a savory context. We’re particularly fond of them as an accompaniment to a cheese board, especially when lightly spread over a rich, full-flavored cheese like Roquefort, or mixed with creamy Chevre. And when mixed with a bit of brown sugar, mustard, and orange liqueur, it makes an easy glaze for pork, poultry, and salmon. Everything’s coming up apricots!

Taking the implicit cue, we’ve applied this namesake technique to a different group of ingredients, calling the final product: Trader Joe’s Organic Roasted Red Pepper and Almond Pesto Sauce.   While there is some basil in this Pesto, the real star of the show is Organic Roasted Red (Bell) Peppers. These are crushed with organic PDO Pecorino Romano cheese, organic almonds, organic onions, organic garlic, and a handful of organic herbs and spices, including marjoram, basil, and paprika. These ingredients are artfully emulsified with a combination of organic extra virgin olive oil and organic sunflower oil. The final flavors are delicately fine-tuned with touches of organic cane sugar, and organic apple cider vinegar.   Although the fiery red-orange color of our Organic Roasted Red Pepper Pesto may look completely different from the pesto of the Genoese, the concept and application is very familiar. Simply take spoonfuls of this rich, roasted, cheesy, nutty, flavorful Sauce and toss it with your favorite cooked Trader Joe’s pasta shape.

We suppose that’s understandable, since we’ve deemed only three wines worthy of this title. The third, in fact, is this Oakville Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.     If you are unfamiliar with the Oakville AVA (American Viticultural Area) of Napa Valley, suffice it to say, it is home to some of the most prestigious Cabernet Sauvignon-focused wineries in the entire world. And this particular wine comes from what is arguably the most famous and influential of them. (Of course, we can’t tell you which one, because then we’d have to charge you a lot more!)    This ruby red wine is stunning and complex.

Trader Joe’s Platinum Reserve Sonoma County Brut is a shining example.    Made for us by an experienced winery partner in the rolling, coastal hills of Sonoma, this bewitching bubbly exhibits all the light fruitiness and crisp edge characteristic of a Méthode Campenoise Brut.

platinum-aged-balsamic-vinegar-of-modena-053741,Platinum Aged Balsamic Vinegar of Modena," Made using traditional methods and under extraordinarily exacting standards, Trader Joe’s Platinum Aged Balsamic Vinegar is crafted for us in Modena, Italy, using the concentrated must of Trebbiano and Lambrusco grapes which were grown in the Reggio Emilia region. A small percentage of red wine vinegar is added, and it’s aged for a minimum of three years in oak wood barrels (per its “Invecchiato” designation). According to the Protected Geographical Indication certification, this traditional vinegar-making process is carefully monitored by a group known as the Balsamic Consortium (who knew?), which strictly regulates every detail—from grape varietals, growing regions and how the grapes are grown, to aging methods and more. The result is a rich Balsamic Vinegar with viscous, honey-like texture and flavor that is richly sweet with a gentle line of acidity.   Its molasses-ness makes our Aged Balsamic Vinegar of Modena better for finishing than for cooking. Drizzle over roasted pork or grilled steak, eggplant, mushrooms or zucchini. Swirl over creamy butternut squash soup or asparagus risotto. Splash over strawberries or sliced plums to showcase fresh fruit flavor. Or partner with a fine extra virgin olive oil for dipping fresh, rustic bread slices.

When it comes to Trader Joe’s holiday products, part of our tradition is to partner with producers who have plenty of experience in making whatever it is they make. For example, we found some candy cane crafters who have been in the business for one hundred years. With just one lick of a Trader Joe’s Handmade Candy Cane, you can tell that tradition is hard at work!    Ironically, their deep candy tradition has produced for us a very unique—one might even say, untraditional Candy Cane. Unlike mass market-produced candy canes that are concocted with high-fructose corn syrup and artificial flavors, our red-and-white-striped Candy Canes are made with peppermint oil, tapioca syrup, and colors derived from red radish. They are hand-pulled, which gives them a beautiful sheen, and they’re generously sized (read: big!). Perhaps the most decidedly untraditional aspect of Trader Joe’s Handmade Candy Canes is the fact that after a bunch of licks, you’ll encounter a soft, Cocoa Crème filling. Yum!    These Handmade Candy Canes make wonderful stocking stuffers, and they are also pretty impressive when included as part of a holiday gift basket.

So what happens when you combine those warm flavors and feelings with a cool and creamy ice cream? In the case of Trader Joe’s Gingerbread Ice Cream, our latest seasonal ice cream, you get a dessert that’s nothing short of homey, holiday magic.    Our supplier takes a three-prong approach to imbuing this Ice Cream with just the right amount of gingerbread flavor. They start with a sweet and generously ginger-spiced ice cream base, then add bite-sized bits of our very own Triple Ginger Snap Cookies (the same you’ll find in our cookie aisle, year-round), before finishing with a splendid gingerbread swirl.

Though the word was originally used as a toast, it was also adopted as the name of a traditional Yuletide beverage—and that’s where our Winter Wassail comes in. It packs quite a punch with its fragrant combination of fruit and spices. We started by blending sweet, fruitful apple and black currant juices with tart lemon juice. An infusion of cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, cardamom, ginger and orange peel turns this from your average punch into a libation—a deliciously Spiced Holiday Libation, at that. (We feel compelled to clarify that there is no alcohol in this otherwise spirited drink.)   Heat our Holiday Libation over the stove with red wine, cinnamon sticks and orange peel for a delicious mulled wine drink (or nix the wine for those younger Spiced Holiday Libation fans). It’s perfect paired with our European Cookie Collection, or as a warm accompaniment on all that door-to-door wassailing you’ll do.

maple-cranberry-orange-spread-074658,Maple Cranberry Orange Spread," The holidays are famous for lots of iconic flavors, from maple and cranberry, to peppermint and cocoa. While you can find a plethora of products on our shelves that each focus on a single one of these flavors, we also like to experiment with flavor combinations. The new Trader Joe’s Maple Orange Cranberry Spread comes to mind.   The first ingredient in this Spread is Maple syrup. The sweet, rich taste of Maple is mingled with Cranberry purée, which contributes some little bits of cranberry and tantilizingly tart notes to this Spread. We could have stopped there, but we wanted to add some citrusy zing to further balance the sweetness. This is where the Orange comes in, in the form of Orange juice concentrate. Among other ingredients, dashes of allspice and cinnamon bring some seasonal warmth, while the addition of butter helps make this festival of holiday flavors super spreadable.   But what does one spread it on? That’s a silly question since there are so many options! Spread it on toast, bagels, pancakes, waffles. Beyond breakfast, this Spread also pairs well with numerous cheeses. Think about including our Maple Orange Cranberry Spread when you’re assembling your holiday party cheese plate or appetizer tray. You can even use this Spread as a marinade base for our All Natural Crate Free Pork Tenderloin. Find it on our shelves with the rest of our jams and spreads, but only for a limited time!

cold-brew-gingerbread-oat-latte-074746,Cold Brew Gingerbread Oat Latte," Latte literally means “milk,” but with the explosion in popularity of espresso drinks over the last few decades, this word by itself now refers specifically to a coffee drink that includes espresso and steamed milk.     Now, it stands to reason that a drink with Latte in the title would at least include milk—however, reason does not always take into account the inexorable and eternal evolution of language. And as Trader Joe’s Cold Brew Gingerbread Oat Latte shows, these days you can have a “latte,” while also avoiding milk altogether! Indeed, this creamy, coffee beverage is non-dairy. It starts with concentrated Cold Brew coffee, to which is added hydrolyzed oat flour (aka Oat “milk”). And like any good latte, this one has been sweetened with the likes of cane and brown sugars.     Aside from it’s special non-dairy status, what also makes this particular Latte so special is the addition of Gingerbread flavors. To achieve this profile, ginger juice, cinnamon, and ground nutmeg are added to the recipe. Just the right proportions of these work together to create a seasonal beverage that evokes all the best holiday memories, while also keeping you well-caffeinated—and milk-free!

double-creme-brie-with-truffles-093288,Double Crème Brie with Truffles," Trader Jacques double crème brie with truffles is a decadent cheese made with real French truffles. This cheese is made by a family-owned cheese manufacturer in the village of Pelussin in the heart of the Rhone-Alps region of France where the world famous Cotes du Rhone wine production occurs. The cheese is made using technology called ultrafiltration, a process that removes the water from pasteurized milk, concentrating the nutrients, proteins and fat; delivering a truly creamy and delicious cheese.   Truffles are a sought after delicacy that impart complex flavors to food. Our truffle brie is made with actual bonafide truffle shavings, not the truffle oil or extract found in other “truffle-flavored” cheeses. This recipe delivers a rich and authentic truffle flavor, soft and smooth texture and a pleasant earthy finish. The creamy, buttery cheese provides a rich back drop for the earthy, slightly salty truffle flavor. Our tasting panel went through many versions of this cheese to perfect the ripeness, texture, salt level and the right balance of truffles.

During the holidays, they’re a great option for featuring in a classic green bean casserole, and can be pickled, blanched, or deep-fried any other time of year.

The sound of a blustery November wind against the window. To us, autumn is all about savoring these consummately cozy feelings, and what could be more cozy than enjoying a sweet and perfectly crumbly scone with a steamy cup of coffee? To that end, we’re excited to introduce Trader Joe’s Glazed Maple Walnut Scones to the shelves of our bakery section this fall. They’re made for us by the same suppliers as our everyday Glazed Vanilla Bean Scones, and have the same satisfyingly soft texture, but with a decidedly autumnal attitude.  Each handmade Scone is coated with a rich, faintly caramel-y Maple glaze, and features savory bits of chopped Walnuts in every bite. It’s the kind of baked treat that can be enjoyed entirely on its own, right out of the bag, but tastes even better when slightly warmed and spread with just a bit of whipped butter or clotted cream. Of course, our absolute favorite way to enjoy it is served alongside with a piping hot cup of coffee or tea for dunking—especially if its something appropriately maple-y, like our Maple Espresso Black Tea!

You can spread it on your morning toast or Crumpets and swirl it into yogurt or oatmeal to wake your taste buds up in the morning. Try adding a couple tablespoons to Reduced Sodium Soy Sauce and aromatics for a lip-smacking stir-fry-style sauce.

Now, you might raise an eyebrow when you notice that our French Apple Tart is made here in the U.S.A., but before you raise that other eyebrow, consider this: the Master Pastry Chef who developed this recipe once made this exact tart—which is constructed and baked according to French tradition—for the President of France himself.

And each 9” Trader Joe’s Pumpkin Pie is made with real, fresh pumpkin purée and spiced with ground cinnamon, ground ginger, & cloves. This silky, custardy filling gets nestled in a tender, flaky crust, then baked to perfection.   This Pumpkin Pie is traditional in every sense, and though it may not be made from scratch by you, it is made from scratch by our supplier, for you.

But the time has come for you to consider both the form and function of the meager trivet. Trader Joe’s Handcrafted Felted Wool Trivets are really so beautiful to behold, you may reconsider their placement under hot pots and pans.   Each Trader Joe’s Handcrafted Felted Wool Trivet is hand-made in Nepal, using 100% New Zealand sheep’s wool. In a process known as “felting,” skilled workers wrap the wool into loose balls, wet them with warm water, hand-roll them while applying significant pressure, then lay them in the sun to dry. (The combination of moisture and warmth works to compact and stiffen the wool fibers – if you’ve ever had the misfortune of accidentally tossing your favorite wool sweater in the wash, you’re familiar with this phenomenon…) Finally, once the individual wool balls are completely dry, 100 of them are handsewn into a square that measures about 6.5” x 6.5”. The finished Trivets are tagged, boxed, and shipped to Trader Joe’s.   We’ve secured a limited quanitity of these Felted Wool Trivets from Nepal, in two color palettes: one made up of muted grays & beiges, and the other a festival of vibrant colors. Both are fully functional, serving to protect your countertops and table surfaces from the hot undersides of pots and pans.

In fact, it’s the English translation of Pinot Noir. Named for its very dark, very tightly clustered grapes on the vine (resembling pine cones), this variety remains one the world’s most popular for making wine.   Beyond its French homeland, Pinot Noir is cultivated successfully in several other regions, not the least of which is the West Coast of the United States. In fact, Trader Joe’s sells a lot of California Pinot Noir. One of our latest comes from Monterey, on California’s rugged central coast.   Trader Joe’s Petit Reserve Monterey Pinot Noir is what ‘black pine’ connoisseurs hope for: aromas of dark berries and red plum, morphing into flavors of raspberry, wild strawberry, and subtle spices on the palate. This fruit-forward wine is on the dryer side, lending a “serious” feel to it. It boasts a silky texture, that still finishes pleasantly bright—ideal for pairing with turkey and all the fixings.

apple-crumble-pie-074908,Apple Crumble Pie," While you might think pumpkin pie is the top pick for Thanksgiving Day dessert, as it turns out, the almighty apple consistently earns the highest marks in myriad un-scientific surveys on the subject. And it makes sense— fall is peak apple season, with fresh crops coming off the trees by the bushel, their sweet-tart flesh and delicious crunch ready to elevate the ever-so-humble pie crust to another level entirely. Trader Joe’s Apple Crumble Pie is a prime example of such pie perfection. Its filling of tender, Northern Spy apples is imbued with warm cinnamon, and nestled between an all-butter pastry crust shell and a crunchy, buttery oat crumble topping with notes of brown sugar. It can be warmed in the oven while you enjoy Thanksgiving Dinner, or served at room temperature with a cup of coffee the next morning. And at eight inches in diameter, it can easily serve six dinner guests (with or without a scoop of TJ’s Super Premium French Vanilla Ice Cream). Apple Crumble Pie for the win!

The Salt crystals are small, delicate, and flaky— the name means salt flower in Portuguese. This Salt contains more moisture than traditional sea salt. It’s preserved in a ceramic crock and topped with a cork lid, which helps protect the crystals and keep them from drying out—it’s a terrific vessel that makes this salt tremendously giftable, and also offers countless re-use options once you’ve enjoyed the contents.   Portuguese Flor de Sal can season all the dishes on your holiday table. It is especially nice as a finishing salt, atop a steak, buttery potatoes—really, you can enjoy it just about anywhere calling for good salt. To really highlight its exceptional, clean flavor, try adding a sprinkle of Flor de Sal to your desserts—it can heighten chocolate notes and help balance the sweetness.

korean-beefless-bulgogi-072949,Korean Beefless Bulgogi," The word bulgogi literally means “fire meat” in Korean. The meat of choice in this popular dish is typically beef, sliced into thin strips, marinated in bulgogi sauce (basically a doctored soy sauce), and “fired” on a grill. We love this dish, and have explored some of our own versions, like Trader Joe’s Korean Inspired Bulgogi Beef Fried Rice with Kimchi to name just one. Continuing our exploration, we’ve chosen some less traditional territory in the creation of Trader Joe’s Korean Beefless Bulgogi.   The fire “meat” in this case is not meat at all. Instead, it’s 100% Beefless textured soy protein. Even so, the marinade is quite traditional, made by our Korean supplier (in the Republic of Korea) using common bulgogi- sauce ingredients, such as soy sauce, pear puree, garlic, ginger, green onions, and sugar. Though completely vegan, the texture of our Beefless Bulgogi is satisfyingly meat-like; and the savory, sweet, salty sauce adds authenticity (not to mention enjoyability!) to the whole eating experience.   Korean Beefless Bulgogi cooks from frozen in 3-7 minutes, depending on your chosen method. Serve it with a side of Organic Jasmine Rice, or in a stir fry with your favorite TJ’s veggies. Since we’ve already gone non-traditional, why not take it a step further and pack some TJ’s tortillas with this Bulgogi for truly inspired, totally meatless tacos?!

cracked-olive-salad-074409,Cracked Olive Salad," Almost all olives must go through a curing process before they’re edible. Fresh, right-off-the-tree olives are full of an extremely bitter-tasting compound called oleuropein, which can be removed by submerging them in various kinds of solutions, or even just packing them in salt, for an extended period of time. In some cases, olive farmers prefer to “crack” their olives prior to curing, by smashing them just enough to allow the pit to be removed. These cracked olives, or olive schiacciate, as they’re known in Italy, absorb more brine than an intact olive as they cure, developing a deeper flavor and softer texture. And when combined with a mix of pickled veggies, capers, and savory seasonings, as they are in Trader Joe’s Cracked Olive Salad, they’re nothing short of a cracking good time.   Equally able as an appetizer, condiment, or side, each jar of Trader Joe’s Cracked Olive Salad is made with both green cracked olives and black pitted olives, capers, and a giardiniera-like mix of pickled cauliflower, carrots, celery, and red peppers, all suspended in oil that’s been seasoned with herbs like oregano and parsley. It makes a great topping for an Italian beef or muffaletta sandwich, a terrific topping for practically any style of pizza, and serves spectacularly well with a charcuterie board or cheese plate. Personally, we like to simply enjoy it as is, as an antipasto-like side for pasta or spread over a nicely toasted crostini.

Each batch starts with a base of light, nutty bulgur wheat, which our supplier seasons with aromatic spices like thyme and turmeric. They then cook it in a mild vegetable broth with bits of sweet and earthy butternut squash until the bulgur takes on a tender, easy- going texture, before finally tossing it all with chunks of tart, tangy, feta cheese. Each forkful offers a variety of textures, from the soft bite of the squash, to the fluffiness of the bulgur, and the teeth-sinking satisfaction of the feta, all bound together by a delightfully savory flavor profile that pairs excellently with practically any protein.   In contrast to the pleasant complexity of its texture and flavor, this Bulgur Wheat couldn’t be simpler to prepare: just a few minutes in the microwave or on the stovetop are all you need to serve it nice and hot. That said, it can also be enjoyed cold, a bit like a tabbouleh, by emptying the bag into a bowl and allowing it to thaw in the fridge overnight. Either way, it pairs most deliciously with a hearty Mediterranean-inspired main course, like grilled Shawarma Chicken Thighs, pan-fried Gyro Slices, or yogurt-marinated salmon kebabs.

Of course, like any hall-of-fame worthy side, it can be a bit time-consuming to prepare from scratch. That’s why we’re proud to offer Trader Joe’s Spanish Style Rice. Each box contains two pouches of pre-prepared Spanish Style Rice that can go from your freezer to your dinner plate in a manner of minutes.

With all that prep work out of the way, you’ll have all the more time to focus on what kind of dish to accessorize with this flavorful, fragrant Rice.

pomander-room-spritz-068392,Pomander Room Spritz," What’s a pomander? In simplest terms, it’s thing of beauty that brightens up the scent of any room. Historically speaking, pomanders, whose name derives from the French pomme d’ambre (amber apple) have been around since the Middle Ages. They were originally perfume balls or bags of herbs, intended to be worn around the neck or waist, primarily to protect the wearer against illness. In the modern era, a pomander is most commonly an orange (or sometimes other citrus relative) that’s been studded with whole cloves (and sometimes cinnamon) and allowed to dry. It is commonly used as a room air freshener, or in dresser drawer to keep clothes smelling fresh.   Trader Jo’e Pomander Room Spritz captures the classic scent of orange-clove-cinnamon in a bottle, allowing you to capture the essence of a pomander with a quick spray. Crafted with orange, Mandarin orange, cinnamon, and clove oils, it evokes the scents of holidays past, present, and future, and leaves your living spaces smelling festive and fabulous.

Round or square pieces of neutral-colored wood or cork do little to inspire. If you need more from your trivets, pick up some of our Handcrafted Felted Wool Trivets today!
 
 Skilled artisans in Nepal use a traditional felting process to create these woolen watchdogs of the worktop. 100% New Zealand sheep’s wool is wrapped into loose balls, moistened with warm water then hand-rolled before being laid out to dry in the sun. The combination of moisture and warmth works to compact and stiffen the wool fibers (like your accidentally washed woolen sweater). Once the individual wool balls are completely dry, 100 of them are handsewn together to make a 6.5-inch x 6.5-inch square. Finally, they’re tagged, boxed, and shipped to your neighborhood Trader Joe’s.

chicken-gyoza-potstickers-003663,Chicken Gyoza Potstickers," According to culinary historians, gyoza (“jiaozi” in Mandarin) were invented by the Chinese.

Already fully cooked, our Chicken Gyoza Potstickers easily fulfill your preparation preference – steam, pan fry, microwave, or add to soup. Our favorite method is to heat oil in a pan (or wok); place the potstickers in the hot pan, bottom side down (creases up), and cook over medium-high until browned and crisped; (optional: carefully turn to brown each side); throw a little water into the pan and cover to steam the dumplings off the pan (take care to not add too much water, as the dough can start to come undone).

gnocchi-073578,Gnocchi," If you’re a pasta fan, and a TJ’s shopper, you really do deserve the best possible pasta—and these fluffy little dumplings really deliver! We challenged our supplier in Italy to make a simple, and simply delicious, five-ingredient Gnocchi without additives, and they gnocch’d it out of the park! That simple recipe: potatoes and a blend of wheat and rice flours, with cultured dextrose and lactic acid to help preserve them. Because they don’t require refrigeration, you can keep them on your pantry shelves for easy access when the Gnocchi craving strikes.   Trader Joe’s Gnocchi are soft, shelf stable, pillows of potato that require little effort to yield a tasty and comforting meal. Boil these beauties for about two minutes before bathing them in salted butter with fresh sage leaves for a luxuriously simple feast. Or skip the boiling water altogether and cook the Gnocchi in a pot of Tomato Basil Marinara, then bake withfresh mozzarella cheese for your own homemade Gnocchi alla Sorrentina.

sage-derby-074936,Sage Derby," A holiday tradition dating back all the way to 17th century England, Sage Derby is well beloved in Britain for its savory, herbaceous taste, firm, buttery texture, and unmistakable green hue. Trader Joe’s Sage Derby (pronounced DAR-bee, across the pond) is crafted especially for us by a small, family-owned cheesemaker in Lancashire, who hand-blends the Cheddar curds with a mix of earthy, aromatic sage and spinach (for color). Each wedge has a marvelously marbled, and—if we dare say so ourselves—charmingly festive appearance, ideal for serving on cheese plates of all kinds.   So how best to enjoy Sage Derby? Aside from simply eating it on its own or with a glass of crisp Chardonnay (which we certainly won’t dissuade you from), it also makes an excellent ingredient in cheese scones, quiches, or potatoes au gratin. For aesthetically-minded foodies, it provides some nicely verdant visuals when cubed and served alongside charcuterie or melted into mac & cheese. And if you’re ready for some exceptionally sage advice, we find its awesomely herbaceous qualities make it a perfect cheese for slicing thin and serving on a roast turkey sandwich. Mmm!

herbes-de-provence-057927,Herbes de Provence," As summer turns to fall, we turn on our ovens. We break out the roasting pans that lay dormant from May to August and dust off our favorite roast chicken and root veggie casserole recipes. But just how will we season our chickens and casseroles (and fish, and turkey, and vegetables) this fall and winter? With Herbes de Provence, of course.   What is it, exactly? Herbes de Provence [ERB-duh-proh-VAHNS] is a mixture of herbs typical of the Provence region in the south of France. It wasn’t commercially available as a ready-to-use blend under that name until the 1970’s, and the specific herbs used in the blend can vary, as cooks choose different herbs to suit their taste. The blend in this jar, created exclusively for us in Florida, is comprised of thyme, marjoram, savory, rosemary, basil, sage and lavender, creating a savory, aromatic seasoning that can be used in a multitude of preparations.   So how, and when, can you use Herbes de Provence? It is usually added before or during cooking, often when oil is heating, which helps to draw out the aromatics and allow them to meld into the recipe. It lends a sense of elegance when roasted with vegetables, and provides a floral balance to savory roasted poultry or fish. And of course, what would the classic Chicken Provençal be without this Provençal-inspired seasoning?   Our Herbes de Provence blend is packed in a wide-mouth jar, complete with a wooden spoon, so you can scoop as much as you need.

sea-salt-crystals-057364,Sea Salt Crystals," Salt is likely the single most important mineral in human culinary history—and probably human existence more broadly. The fact that we very much need it for our brains and bodies to function properly aside, salt is essential in preserving food, in killing foodborne pathogens, and in allowing the flavor receptors on our tongues to fully perceive sweet, sour, and umami tastes. Across time and countless cultures, salt has held immeasurable social, economic, and religious importance, and provided the etymological inspiration for words like sauce, sausage,  salad, salacious, and salary (among many others). All this to say: salt is pretty darn important! So it might as well be easy to work with, like it is with Trader Joe’s Sea Salt Crystals. Made with hefty-sized sea salt crystals sourced from South Africa, our Sea Salt comes in a jar with a convenient grinder already attached. Which means that all it takes to add just the right amount of salt to any kind of dish is a couple of satisfyingly crackly spins of the lid. Since it’s such a crucial part of any pantry, we’re proud to say that our Sea Salt is of dependably excellent quality, and sells for an equally excellent everyday price.

organic-bread-crumbs-092978,Organic Bread Crumbs," In the world of fiction, bread crumbs are most famously associated with the fairy tale of Hansel and Gretel. In that story, two wayward tots used them as a tool to keep track of their progress in the forest, only to find that birds had eaten them when they attempted to backtrack. What does this tell us about bread crumbs? If nothing else, they’re much more delicious than they are a useful geolocational tool. Trader Joe’s Organic Bread Crumbs are certainly delicious, and they’re made with organic ingredients to boot. And they’re definitely better suited for the kitchen than orienting yourself in the woods—just in case that was still on your mind.  Whether you’re in the mood for making fried fish, meatloaf, or a cheesy casserole, it’s always an excellent idea to keep a pouch of our Organic Bread Crumbs on hand. They add much-needed body and texture to crab cakes, meatballs, and salmon patties, a delightfully crispy pop of texture when used to top baked mac and cheese, and make a superlatively delicious breading for pork cutlets, chicken cordon bleu, or air-fried pickles.

What’s beneath and between that lovely, creamy cheese is a combination of Roasted Vegetables, including cauliflower, butternut squash, and kale. But what really puts this Gratin over the top, is the inclusion of White Beans. These butter beans add more creaminess, plus a slightly denser texture. Finished with panko bread crumbs and seasonings that include onion, thyme, and parsley, this may be one of the most satisfyingly savory sides you’ll enjoy this season.   And if you are serving it alongside a turkey, this dish need not compete for oven time. While we do recommend cooking our Roasted Vegetable and White Bean Gratin in the conventional oven at 350°F for about 25 minutes, you’ll save minutes and oven space by heating it in the microwave, with similar results.

Cool, coastal micro-climates serve as a natural pest repellant, keeping the bugs at bay. We’ve since partnered with experienced farmers, to bring you Trader Joe’s Organic Brussels Sprouts. Grown with care in pristine, mineral-rich fields, without the use of any synthetic pesticides or chemical fertilizers, these certified Organic Sprouts are quite something. They’re as rich in flavor as they are nutrients (an excellent source of vitamins C and K, a good source of vitamin A, folate, manganese, dietary fiber... the list goes on), and make an ideal side for practically any protein you can name.

We’ve offered several different iterations of these chewy, rice dough-wrapped ice cream orbs over the years, and for our latest, Trader Joe’s Caramel Apple Mochi, we’ve taken inspiration from a true autumnal icon: the beloved Caramel Apple. To be specific, we’ve infused each scoop of ice cream with bits of sweet, luscious caramel, apple purée, apple juice concentrate, and natural caramel & apple flavors. Then, we’ve wrapped said scoops in chewy, caramel-hued rice dough. The end result? A batch of two-or-three-bite-sized balls of (literal) melt-in-your-mouth fall flavor! Bobbing for Mochi, anyone?

shishito-peppers-054163,Shishito Peppers," An exotic delicacy iconic to izakaya (Japanese tapas/appetizers/bar food), Shishito Peppers have become a ubiquitous and fashionable finger food of late. Here’s why: Shishito Peppers are enormously delicious and a bit daring, couldn’t be simpler to prepare, are famously finger-friendly, and make perfect appetizers.   Native to Japan (perhaps via Portugal, some speculate), the slender, green peppers have delicate skin and a slightly pleated surface that makes for a fresh crunch raw or a tender bite cooked. They have a whisper of grassy and peppery flavor, with a faint note of citrus. And—here’s the kicker—some (approximately one in ten) have a real kick! So popping peppers is a bit roulette-y: mild, mild, mild, POW!... The hit of heat and suspense are addicting.   Minimal prep is the key to highlighting their bright flavor. Simply heat oil (olive or sesame) in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat, and cook the peppers, turning occasionally, until they begin to blister on all sides. Sprinkle with a bit of sea salt—they are ready to enjoy! They are also wonderful grilled or deep fried, and partnered with a Soyaki-style sauce or Sriracha cream for dipping. They are ideal appetizers. They can also be tossed on top of pizzas or served alongside steaks. We’ve even seen them served as a cocktail garnish.

Obviously, corn is one of the more versatile ingredients in your pantry. You hardly need suggestions for corn, right? But we’d be remiss if we didn’t give you one just the same.

So, on account of the fact that a different species of flora could lure the bees out of their beloved clover fields from time to time, we’ve added “Multi-Floral” to its moniker.

Made from allowing soy milk to curdle, tofu can be packaged in a variety of softness: silken, soft, firm, and extra firm. Firm Tofu is most similar to the texture of all the raw meat and seafood we stock on our shelves, making it a popular meat alternative.

organic-carrots-of-many-colors-051475,Organic Carrots of Many Colors," Did you know that we Americans consume more carrots than any other people in the world? It’s true. On average, each of us consumes 11.5 pounds of these robust root veggies a year. Can you even imagine how those numbers would increase if more people knew they could get carrots in (almost) all the colors of the rainbow? We’re on a mission to make that happen, one carrot at a time, with Trader Joe’s and the Organic Carrots of Many Colors.   A little history… until a few hundred years ago, carrots were most common in myriad colors. The Dutch combined a yellow carrot with a red one and came up with orange, their national color. These new carrots took hold and became the standard by which other carrots are judged. These days, the colorful originals are making a comeback, and while we’re big fans of orange carrots, we also have a strong affinity for the Organic Carrots of Many Colors. Every two pound bag is filled with a random assortment of yellow, cream/white, red, and of course orange carrots. They all taste like carrots – no surprise there – but their color really pops on a plate.   Slice these vibrant taproots into spears, present them on a tray, and serve them with your favorite dip. Or toss them with olive oil, salt & pepper and roast them in a 400º oven for about 20 minutes – their hues will subdue when cooked, but their naturally sweet flavor will really shine and complement your entrée.

salted-caramel-hot-cocoa-061572,Salted Caramel Hot Cocoa," While it's generally accepted that the Mayans were the first to make a beverage out of chocolate, this drink bore little resemblance to what we now know as hot chocolate. It was spicy and bitter and definitely an acquired taste. It's the seventeenth century Europeans, historically speaking, who get the credit for adding sugar to this bitter concoction, making it eminently more palatable and desirable.   With the introduction of Trader Joe's Salted Caramel Flavored Hot Cocoa, we'll humbly take the credit for making this classic beverage even more palatable and desirable. We've taken traditional hot cocoa mix - you know, one that's rich and creamy and sweet and incredibly delicious in every way - and added natural caramel flavor, so that every sip delivers the enhanced richness and sweetness of caramel. But we didn't stop there. Nope. We went all the way in, adding salt to the caramel flavor, so that the final result, when mixed with hot water or milk, is the warm, liquid manifestation of our ever-popular Dark Chocolate Sea Salt Caramels.

From there, you’re free to pair it up with your favorite protein, accessorize it with cranberry sauce or gravy (or both!), or even sneak it into a sandwich, if you’re so inclined. Whether you’re looking to lighten your workload this holiday season, in need of a dish for a holiday potluck, or are simply in the mood for something homey and delicious, this is the Stuffing that dreams are made of.","['Food', 'Fresh Prepared Foods', 'Entrées & Center of Plate']",https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/cornbread-stuffing-071889,$5.99,17 Oz,,,[],"CONTAINS MILK, WHEAT.","['Effortless Entertaining', 'Fall Faves', 'Family Style']",['1 cup(100g)'],['160 ']

green-onions-044168,Green Onions," No mere garnish, and not exactly the same thing as scallions, Green Onions can be used to flavor all kinds of things. Let’s start in the middle, with the scallion thing. Green Onions do in fact look like scallions to the untrained eye (e.g., our eyes until we learned this), except scallions haven’t developed a bulb at all. Green Onions have. It’s a subtle difference, but a difference nonetheless.   Both scallions and Green Onions are white onions, harvested quite young, that feature long, straight, edible, green leaves and mild onion flavor. That mild onion flavor complements so many different foods. Add chopped green onions – leaves and bulbs together – to soups, stews, and sauces. Blend them into burgers and meatloaf. Or lightly salt them, char on your grill, and serve with fresh lime wedges and a dash of Chile Lime Seasoning – this way, they make excellent partners to steak, carne asada, grilled chicken, or grilled salmon.   Of course, you can use Trader Joe’s Green Onions as garnish. Just remember they’re the kind of garnish you actually want to eat.

On the other side of the spectrum is Trader Joe’s Imported Olive Oil, a blend of extra virgin and refined olive oil that delivers a lighter-colored and more neutral-flavored oil.   Our Imported Olive Oil comes from olives that are harvested throughout some of Europe’s best olive-growing regions – specifically, Italy, Greece, and Spain. The oil is packed in Italy, and shipped to your neighborhood Trader Joe’s. Because the olive’s flavors are less prominent, it’s ideal for use in recipes calling for vegetable oil , and especially in cooking situations calling for higher heat.

With regard to eggs, we offer a range of choices from both “conventional” and “cage-free” sources. Currently, well over half of the eggs that we sell at Trader Joe’s are from cage-free hens, and as we continue to listen to our customers (and as the supply-side of the egg business evolves to keep pace with a growing cage-free preference), we continue to add cage-free options to our egg section.

rutland-red-leicester-cheese-070331,Rutland Red Leicester Cheese," Sometimes, to make something truly great, you’ve got to do it by hand. Just ask the cheesemakers behind Trader Joe’s Rutland Red Leicester. Based in the county of Leicestershire in the United Kingdom, these experts prepare each batch of Rutland Red by hand-coating the blocks of cheese in butter, then hand-wrapping them in cloth before leaving them to mature. As the cheese ages, the cloth seals in the butter, and the butter keeps the cheese moist, resulting in a super crumbly cheese that simply melts in your mouth.   From its striking red-orange hue (courtesy of annato, the same natural dye used in orange Cheddars) to its mild, caramel-y flavor, TJ’s Rutland Red Leicester possesses all the unique, delicious, and versatile characteristics you want in a special, seasonal cheese. It adds visual flair and savory sophistication to a charcuterie board, brings a delightful and somewhat spooky something extra to mashed potatoes and omelets, and pairs perfectly with a good I.P.A. or ale. But if this big Red sounds appealing, you’ll have to snack fast—just like fall, this limited-time Leicester is fleeting.

Seasonings like garlic, chili powder, cilantro, cumin, oregano, cayenne, and lime juice add some southwestern style. Oh, and did we mention it’s chock-full of white beans, corn, poblano peppers, and organic chicken breast—just like a chunky chili?

You don’t need to be adept at reading leaves to decipher that harvest memories are made in Trader Joe’s Harvest Blend Herbal Tea.   With aromatic bursts of cinnamon and ginger, an abundance of apple flavor and a sweet-spicy lingering finish, Trader Joe’s Harvest Blend Herbal Tea delivers a season’s-worth of experiences in a sip. Don’t let that stop you from seeking out those experiences yourself, though. In fact, we encourage it! Brew a cup and head out to the pumpkin patch or take a walk in the brisk fall weather.

semi-sweet-chocolate-chunks-051482,Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chunks," The great baking debate: Chips vs. Chunks vs. Chopped – chocolate, that is. We like to engage in all discourse around baking, especially when it comes to chocolate, but to do so knowledgeably, we needed to create Trader Joe’s Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chunks. Made from 58.9% cocoa, a higher percentage than our chips, these chunks balance rich, dark chocolate with the perfect amount of sweetness. Unlike chips, these chunks are not formulated to hold their shape, so they melt more easily, thus covering more territory (in cookies, let’s say). And because they are irregularly shaped, you can expect some “chocolate debris” from chunks, but significantly less than if you were to chop the chocolate yourself. In summary, Trader Joe’s Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chunks promise premium chocolate flavor, are easily prepared and measured, and melt smoothly & quickly, which makes them exceptional for baking and candy making. They are also sensational for snacking. You don’t need to bake to enjoy great chocolate, after all.   Made for us by an esteemed French-Belgian chocolate company that now produces product in North America, our Chocolate Chunks are of the same caliber that high-end bakeries and notable candy manufacturers use. We think our customers deserve the best; price included.   So... which are better? Chunks, chips, or chopped? Well, the fun part is, that’s still up for debate!

Over the years, we’ve developed limited-edition versions to celebrate different seasons and flavors (see: new Pumpkin Spiced Joe-Joe’s) In the interest of full transparency, we’ve had a few minor misses over the years, but when a Joe-Joe hits, longevity is often the result. Case in point: Trader Joe’s Halloween Joe-Joe’s, a holiday favorite for 10 years and counting!   Think of our Halloween Joe-Joe’s as regular Joe-Joe’s wearing a Halloween costume. They’re the same chocolate and vanilla crème sandwich cookies you know and love, but we’ve added annatto to the crème to give it a bright orange hue and “carved” the cocoa-flavored biscuits to look like jack-o-lanterns.

Trader Joe’s Roasted Turkey & Sweet Potato Burrito is a flour tortilla filled with fall-feast favorites, including sweet potatoes, cranberry salsa, and seasoned white turkey meat—plus burrito hall-of-famers like rice, black beans, and a variety of chile pepper seasonings. All you have to do to enjoy it is pop it in the microwave for about 90 seconds.

These cute, flavorful bell Peppers are a varietal known for its thick walls, which result in a superlatively satisfying crunch with every bite. They also have fewer seeds than other varietals, making them excellent vehicles for dips of all kinds, from herby hummus to our Unexpected Cheddar Cheese Spread. They’re also quite convenient for slicing and incorporating into salads, stir-fries, and soups. Stuffed with cheese or savory-seasoned ground meat, they even make a charming meal on their own.

It’s been off all summer, but as temperatures begin to cool, our appetites crave the low-and-slow, deeply melded, caramelized flavors that only a good roasting can yield. To help kick off roasting season, allow us to introduce Trader Joe’s Pumpkin Chipotle Roasting Sauce. With its bespeckled, red-orange hue, not only does this Sauce look like fall, but it tastes like fall, too. You’ll find plenty of creamy, savory Pumpkin flavor, accented with classic warming spices, like cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, allspice, and clove. You’ll also note its serious depth and complexity, thanks to tangy apple cider vinegar, sweet molasses, and, of course, smoky Chipotle peppers in adobo sauce.   Use this Sauce to coat some Baby Cauliflower and Organic Mini Sweet Peppers before roasting them in a hot oven. Make it a marinade for chicken or pork to turn into an aromatic, shredded taco filling.

It’s an obvious choice for tossing with Organic Baby Spinach & Spring Mix, but that’s just the starting point. It adds seasoning to roasted sweet potatoes and squash.

Crafted for us by a small, family-owned creamery in Northwest England, this savory supergroup is made with Cheshire, Cheddar, Double Gloucester and Red Leicester, arranged in alternating layers of yellow, orange, and white. Each bite will take your taste buds on a tour of the English countryside, where you’ll savor some of the most celebrated cheeses from across the British Isles.   Individually, each of Joe’s stripes is creamy, salty, and sharp in its own, unique way. When eaten all together, those subtle differences compose a kind of culinary harmony suited for melting over burgers, grating over a salad, or simply enjoying on its own, paired with a frosty Howling Gourds Pumpkin Ale. Those stripes also provide some visual appeal on a charcuterie board or cheese plate.

That’s a rhetorical question, and believe it or not, there are other varietals grown in this famous and fruitful valley. For instance, if we focus on temperate, lower Napa—beneficiary of cool breezes due to its proximity to the Bay—we might ask a similar but different question: Who doesn’t love a Pinot Noir from Napa? We certainly do, and we definitely love Trader Joe’s Grand Reserve Pinot Noir Lot #110.   Balanced with a bit of Syrah and Petit Verdot, this Pinot will easily hold its own with some of the best from the region. It’s ruby red with a medium body, silky texture, and lingering finish.

Made for us by one of our trusted wine partners, Block Dark Red is a Blend of bold, ruby red wines, carefully combined to achieve a well-rounded flavor with notes of juicy fruit and rich vanilla. It’s an ideal partner for pizzas, pasta, roasts, and red meat, but honestly, it’s so versatile that you can pair it with practically anything. It’s also a superb wine for simply sipping on its own.   We should also mention that each three-liter box of Block Dark Red Blend comes installed with an airtight nozzle for both ease of pouring and to preserve freshness between pours, making this wine big on convenience, too!  ","['Beverages', 'Wine, Beer & Liquor']",https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/block-red-wine-dark-red-blend-074821,$12.99,3 L,,,[],,"['Bibulous', 'Glass Half Full']",[],[]

As its name would suggest, the beans come to us from the Arroyo Bonito Estate, located at about 4,500 feet above sea level in the D.R.’s mountainous, central region. There, the coffee plants thrive in the fertile mountain soil, under a canopy of pine, macadamia, and guava trees.   The farm is owned and operated by a family with over 30 years of coffee cultivation experience who—following their own unique, natural, wine-like process—allow the beans to over-ripen just a bit before harvest, resulting in a higher sugar concentration. The sweet, coffee cherries are dried in the sun for 21 days, then milled very slowly to thoroughly crack the outer husks. Finally, they’re set aside to “rest” an additional 30 days before being sent stateside to be roasted. The whole process yields a well-balanced cup of 100% Arabica, medium-roast coffee with a nice “wine-y” taste and notes of dried cherry, raisin and plum.

Take Trader Joe’s Triple Cream Brie Cheese with Green Peppercorns, for instance. Buttery, soft-ripened Triple Cream Brie is a delight on all its own, but by adding in the piquant pop of Green Peppercorns (i.e., black peppercorns before they’re blanched and dried), our supplier, an expert cheesemaker based in Germany, has created something entirely unique: a cheese that’s rich, creamy, zesty, and even just a touch spicy, all at once.   Ideal for cheeseboards and charcuterie plates, great on a grilled cheese or patty melt, and a wonder when simply enjoyed out of the fridge, this plush-yet-peppery Brie is truly something to behold. Try melting it over a flatbread with prosciutto and chopped figs for an elevated appetizer, or stuffing into a flattened chicken cutlet before breading and pan-frying for a first-rate cordon bleu. We find that its full flavor and delicate spice combine especially well with sweeter flavors: try pairing it with sliced pears, a drizzle of honey, or a dollop of your favorite fruit preserves.

And what’s better at making a splash than a waterfall? So named for the Italian word for “little waterfall”, Cascatelli don’t just resemble an awe-inspiring natural phenomenon, they’ve become something of a phenomenon in their own right. An international sensation since their debut in 2021, they were designed by an American food journalist intent on creating the perfect pasta shape based on three criteria: forkability (the ease with which one can pick up and hold the pasta on your fork), sauceability (their ability to retain sauce), and toothsinkability (a satisfyingly toothsome texture). Trader Joe’s Organic Cascatelli, we’re excited to tell you, passes all three tests with flying colors.   Made for us by a trusted organic pasta supplier, who worked directly with the shape’s inventor to bring it into our stores, our Organic Cascatelli exceeded our tasting panel’s lofty expectations. Their slightly curved shape and narrow, lasagna-like side ruffles give them a real edge in holding onto pestos and meaty ragus. They cook to a firm, yet yielding, texture, with a delectable, tender chewiness. And, indeed, they’re much easier to hold with a fork than their longer, thinner counterparts. Try Trader Joe’s Organic Cascatelli with plenty of Turkey Bolognese or Pesto Rosso to see just how much these three aspects make a difference. If you’re anything like us, you’ll immediately want to try it again with a few other sauces — just to be sure, of course.

gochujang-paste-073246,Gochujang Paste," With origins dating to at least the 1600s, and possibly earlier, gochujang isn’t so much an ingredient as it is an institution of Korean cuisine unto itself. Traditionally made from a mix of fermented soybeans, rice, barley, salt, and, of course, spicy red peppers, gochujang has a thick consistency and a delightfully complex flavor that’s a rare mix of savory, sweet, and spicy, all at once. In the case of Trader Joe’s Gochujang, we reached out to a supplier in South Korea who uses traditional fermentation techniques to achieve this uniquely delicious flavor profile, resulting in a highly versatile pepper paste that works just as well as a condiment as it does a soup base, a marinade, a dipping sauce, and so much more.   Our Gochujang’s beautifully balanced elements of sweet and heat make it an excellent choice for flavoring proteins of all kinds, from barbecued beef to pan-seared porkloin, crispy fried chicken wings to hearty tofu stew. It can spice up burgers when used as a spread, can be enjoyed with french fries either on its own or mixed with mayo, and adds a whole new dimension of flavor when added to noodle soups. And for a fun, fiery appetizer, it’s great for making kimchi-inspired quick pickles with salted smashed cucumbers.

Each one-two-bite- sized Pretzel Slim is thin, crispy, and studded with coarse crystal of salt, just like a classic pretzel. Unlike your everyday pretzel, however, their increased surface area allows them to be used as a vehicle for a wide variety of dips, cheeses, spreads — even salsas, if you so choose — meaning these Pretzel Slims aren’t just delicious, they’re postively practical.   Made from just four simple ingredients (wheat flour, sugar, salt, and barley malt syrup), we reccomend dunking your Pretzel Slims into Pub Cheese (with or without Jalapeños), Organic Buffalo Style Hummus, or even a jar of Aioli Garlic Mustard Sauce.

simply-eggless-plant-based-egg-074840,Simply Eggless Plant Based Egg," It’s called “Simply Eggless,” but is it really that simple? Yes! And no. It’s simple because the contents of the bottle are ready to shake, pour, and scramble like eggs—or to use in your baking recipes.   But one might also say it’s not that simple, if you think about the challenge the Simply Eggless creators faced in coming up with a 100% plant-based, egg substitute that still cooks and tastes like real eggs. How did they do it? The key is lupin beans. These bright-yellow legumes—with a history dating back to ancient Egypt—have an egg-like texture and taste when cooked. This means Simply Eggless can be used in just about any way you might use real eggs.   Shake the bottle well, then pour into a medium-hot pan on the stove to make an omelet or scrambled “eggs.” Use the scramble in a vegan burrito, alongside our Soy Chorizo. You can even use Simply Eggless in your baked goods, substituting 3 Tbsp. for each egg in the recipe.   Simply Eggless is also a simple choice, especially if you’re vegan, or you’re looking for a cholesterol-free egg substitute. It’s rich in protein, while also being free of dairy, soy, gluten, nuts... and, of course, eggs!

The dough has been folded to create thin layers, which translate into a crisp texture that even has “bubbles” like a regular pizza crust—minus the gluten.   The great texture and flavor of these Crusts is made even more appealing by their convenience. Whenever you’re craving pizza, just pull one from your freezer (there are two, 9.5-inch Crusts in each package), and let it sit at room temperature while your oven preheats to 425°F. Top it with whatever you like. Keep it vegan with Dairy Free Mozzarella Style Shreds Cashew Cheese Alternative, Campari Tomatoes, and Organic Basil. If gluten free is your only requirement, you might try it topped with some Trader Joe’s Spicy Italian Sausage, and Lite Shredded Mozzarella.

organic-pineapple-chunks-071648,Organic Pineapple Chunks," Each jar of Trader Joe’s Organic Pineapple Chunks in Pineapple Juice contains exactly two ingredients: organic pineapple, cut into manageably sized segments, and sweet, organic pineapple juice. Both the pineapple and its juice come to us from Thailand, where pineapples are grown nearly year-round, and where they happen to produce some of the sweetest, highest quality pineapple our panel has ever tasted—and we’ve tasted quite a few. And though the ingredient list may be small, the flavors are anything but: ripe, well-rounded, and with only the faintest bit of acidity to keep things balanced, these Organic Pineapple Chunks will cover all your baking, grilling, stir-frying—or even just snacking—needs.   By packing these Chunks of Pineapple in their own juice, our supplier not only preseves their sweet, tropical flavor, but also keeps them super juicy and ready-to-eat, right out of the jar. In fact, one of our favorite uses for them is simply as a topping for yogurt, cottage cheese, or ice cream. Of course, they have plenty of savory applications, too, from pizza, to fried rice, to Thai curries, and more.

mascarpone-042747,Mascarpone," Hailing from the Lombardy region of Italy just southwest of Milan, the Mascarpone story begins. While we got plenty of positives from Italy during the Renaissance, this fresh, cream cheese offering may be one of the best thing that came out of the turn from 16th to 17th century.   Unlike many of the other cheeses you’ll find in our refrigerators, Mascarpone is a pasteurized milk and cream cheese that is coagulated from the use of an acidic substances (in this case we use citric acid, but historically lemon juice and vinegar have been used). After the curdling, the whey is removed without pressing or aging resulting in a thick crème fraîche-like cheese with a fat content upwards of 60%+.   The final product is that of a smooth, thickened cream not far from the texture of whipped butter. This light texture continues with a mildly flavored, milky flavored cheese that is so mellow in flavor it can lend itself to both sweet and savory dishes. Mascarpone is used in tons of northern Italian dishes and desserts because the original flavor goes well with anything from mustard and spices to sweet cocoa and coffee. Grab a tub today and take your culinary travels to Italy with a Mascarpone recipe!

lemon-curd-007850,Lemon Curd," If cheese is the only thing that comes to mind when you hear the term “curd,” it’s time to expand your culinary horizons. Simply put, fruit curds are a category of preserves in a class of their own, made by cooking fruit juice with eggs and butter. Typically served with scones or bread as an alternative to jam, fruit curds are woven into British teatime tradition—which is why our Buyer went straight to the source to develop Trader Joe’s Authentic Lemon Curd.   Our Lemon Curd is imported from England, where it’s been made exclusively for us for nearly 15 years. Cane sugar, whole eggs, and butter are slow-cooked in small batches with lemon juice concentrate, lemon oil, and pectin; because the characteristics of the lemon juice can vary slightly from batch to batch, this labor-intensive process is overseen by a kettle master, whose sole purpose is to stir the curd and monitor its flavor, satiny texture, and vibrant sheen until it’s just right. When the mixture cools, it transforms into a luxuriously thick, glossy, golden-yellow spread, imbued with the aroma of freshly baked lemon bars. Yum…   With flavors of rich butter and sweet sugar contrasted by bright, tangy lemon, you might refer to our Lemon Curd as “sunshine in a jar.” After all, a spoonful of the stuff has the power to brighten up breakfast, baked goods, and all sorts of sweets and treats in between. Slather it on toast or stir it into yogurt. Drizzle it on pancakes, or ice cream, or cheesecake. If you want to get fancy, whip up some heavy cream and fold it into the Lemon Curd for an almost-effortless tart or layer cake filling worthy of a royal afternoon tea.

If you can imagine how much better you’d be after a year in a spa, you can begin to imagine how delightful prosciutto can be. Trader Joe’s Sliced Prosciutto lives up to this promise.   Our Sliced Prosciutto is crafted for us by a well-known, award-winning Italian salumeri here in the U.S. They begin with full hams that are cured in the traditional Italian style, then allowed to age slowly for 10-12 months. As the hams age, their flavor intensifies and their character builds, resulting in richly-flavored Prosciutto that’s outstanding on Panini with arugula & Asiago, a natural with melon for brunch or hors d’oeuvres and super on a pizza – try it with pesto or a cream-based sauce and inch-long cuts of asparagus.

sriracha-flavored-baked-tofu-056423,Sriracha Flavored Baked Tofu," One of the greatest things about tofu, aside from its obvious health benefits, is its ability to absorb the flavors of the marinades and spices with which it’s cooked. When you begin with naked tofu, marinate for a few hours, and then cook the tofu, it miraculously tastes just like the marinade. It’s tofu’s gift to chefs everywhere. Our gift to tofu-eaters everywhere is Trader Joe’s Sriracha Flavored Baked Tofu.   Using non-GMO sprouted soybeans, our supplier creates bean-curd by coagulating soy milk to yield soft, white curds. These curds are then pressed into firm tofu squares, which are subsequently marinated in spicy Sriracha for 12 hours and finally baked to perfectly textured, flavor-filled tofu. The long marinating process allows the tofu to absorb the sauce’s fiery spiciness and it’s subtle sweetness, along with a hint of garlic for an added depth of flavor. It also creates a red and white marbling that is as striking, as it is fiery-delicious.   Cut open the package and enjoy the Sriracha Flavored Baked Tofu just as it is—it’s cooked and ready to enjoy. Try it with our Organic Herb Salad Mix. Or, slice and stir-fry it with our Asian Stir Fry mix, and then serve it with steamed Jasmine Rice and perhaps a dash of… Sriracha!

shawarma-chicken-thighs-060667,Shawarma Chicken Thighs," Yes, shawarma is typically cooked on a vertical spit (those rotisserie-like skewers that hold impressive amounts of meat).

It’s this crucial component that makes our new Trader Joe’s Shawarma Chicken Thighs so wondrously good.   Boneless, skinless chicken thighs are seasoned with a shawarma spice marinade made of onion, garlic, sea salt, cumin, cinnamon, coriander, paprika, turmeric, and parsley. Yes, we used almost the entire spice rack, but each one is vitally important, adding just the right amount of flavor to create glorious Shawarma Chicken Thighs.   Though it’d be handy, you do not need to have a vertical spit installed in your home to cook this Shawarma Chicken; a grill or an oven will do just fine. More than fine, actually.

vanilla-almond-spiced-chai-protein-smoothie-057011,Vanilla Almond Spiced Chai Protein Smoothie," A long time ago in a land far, far away, chai—as we know and love it—was born. Okay, so we don’t technically know when and where the first cup of chai was brewed—but we do know that sometime in the late 19th century, Great Britain was pulling out all the stops in an effort to increase black tea consumption wide and far. Lucky for us, in India, these promotional efforts birthed the ultimate East-meets-West beverage: black tea brewed according to Indian tradition (with plenty of aromatic spices) and served according to British tradition (with plenty of milk and sugar). Hi, chai.   Now, over a hundred years later in your neighborhood store, another chai hero is born: Trader Joe’s Vanilla Almond Spiced Chai. Like the chai of yesteryear, our Vanilla Almond Spiced Chai strikes the perfect balance between comfortingly sweet and pleasantly spicy. All the usual suspects are present (cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, allspice, and black pepper), plus the addition of vanilla extract to tweak the flavor profile—but unlike the chai of yesteryear, this Chai is vegan and contains absolutely no dairy. Instead, the spices are softened by pea protein powder, almond paste, and coconut cream. And this beverage isn’t just East-meets-West; boasting 16 grams of protein per bottle, it’s also nutrition-meets-indulgence.

They also sport eye-catching, contrastingly-colored green (not white) stems & stalks, which we’ve purposefully given a longer trim than you’d see on ordinary cauliflower florets—so that you can enjoy more of their toothsome tenderness and mild, nutty cauli-flavor.   Add TJ’s Baby Cauliflower to an Asian-inspired stir fry or a lemon-y linguine. For a snazzy side dish, toss it with olive oil, minced garlic, and chopped parsley; roast or sauté it until it’s tender; then serve it with salmon or steak. Or, if you like, skip the cooking altogether and serve these babies simple & raw, on a crudité platter, preferably alongside your TJ’s hummus of choice.

banana-pudding-flavored-ice-cream-074560,Banana Pudding Flavored Ice Cream," Calling all banana fans! The latest entry into our seasonal ice cream lineup is sure to have a certain appeal for you. Made for us by the same supplier as some of our other (widely celebrated, if we do say so ourselves) seasonal ice cream pints, each bite of Trader Joe’s Banana Pudding Flavored Ice Cream expertly evokes the taste of a classically sweet and creamy banana pudding. In fact, every batch even contains bite-sized bits of vanilla-flavored wafer cookies to provide the same delightful textural element as you’d find in banana pudding dishes at potluck dessert tables across the country. We’re not just saying you’ll love it—we’re saying you’ll love it a whole bunch. (We’ll see ourselves out, thank you.)   In addition to the previously mentioned wafer cookies, our supplier deftly flavors this Ice Cream with banana purée to provide a perfect banana baseline, as well as a rich salted caramel swirl to tie everything else together. While it makes an excellent anytime treat, we find that it’s best enjoyed as a satisfyingly sweet reward at the end of a hot summer day. And if you really want to take things to the next level, you can treat it like a deconstructed, reconstructed banana split and top it with whipped cream, your favorite chopped nuts, and one of our Dark Chocolate Covered Cherries.

And did you know that it’s one of the most nutritionally dense vegetables in the world? Bok choy is a cruciferous vegetable (a relative of cabbage) that’s loaded with vitamins A, C, and K, as well as folate and calcium. Unique to bok choy among its peers, interestingly, is the bioavailability of its calcium (how much can actually be absorbed by the human body). A full 54% of bok choy’s calcium can be absorbed by the body. By way of comparison, the figure for spinach, a very healthy green, is just five percent. It’s even higher than milk, which comes in at 32%.You can use Baby Bok Choy in soups and stir-frys, salads and side dishes. Slice it into long strips for stir-fry, blend it into a chopped salad, or sauté it in a bit of olive oil and garlic for a slightly sweet, crisp veggie side that will enliven any meal. Now you know.

general-tsao-stir-fry-sauce-057473,General Tsao Stir Fry Sauce," A staple of many North American Chinese restaurant menus, most sources agree that General Tsao’s Chicken (sometimes spelled Tso or Zuo) was invented in New York in the 1970s by chef Peng Chang-kuei. Though it has no historical relation to the real General Tsao Tsung-T’ang, a 19th century military leader from Hunan and prominent figure in the Taiping Rebellion, it’s likely it was named in his honor as a nod to its creator’s Hunan roots, and specialization in Hunanese cuisine. In turn, Trader Joe’s General Tsao Stir Fry Sauce is a nod to this sweet and lightly spicy comfort food favorite, bringing you the same bright flavors and satisfying heat that have delighted diners on crispy chicken for nearly 50 years.Indeed, our General Tsao Sauce is quite delicious when served over battered and fried chicken, but that’s just a starting point. It also makes a great base for stir fries of all kinds, an excellent dipping sauce with dumplings or crispy veggies, and a phenomenal marinade for pork, poultry, beef, or fish. For a quick, easy, and sweetly spicy side, simply toss some steamed broccoli or cauliflower with a few tablespoons of this Sauce and serve. Delicious!

plain-whole-milk-greek-yogurt-069169,Plain Whole Milk Greek Yogurt," Did you know? Greek yogurt isn’t specifically “Greek”, per se—it simply has that reputation due to the fact that a yogurt company with origins in Greece was one of the first to introduce yogurt to the U.S. that had most of its liquid strained out (called straggisto in Greece). While not solely a Greek invention, this technique is certainly popular in Greece, and elsewhere around the globe, since the straining process leaves it with its signature tangy yogurt flavor, but a texture closer to that of sour cream. All that said: we love Greek yogurt. The tang! The texture! And we know you love it, too, because we sell more Greek style yogurt than you can shake a strainer at. Trader Joe’s Greek Yogurts are made for us by a “yogurteria” that scores big on tang, texture, and of course, value! Our Plain Whole Milk Greek Yogurt is made, as one might expect, using whole milk, so it’s a “full fat” yogurt. Its rich flavor and thick, yet smooth, consistency are ideal complements to the inherent tanginess of Greek style yogurt. It’s luscious, flavorful, and creamy, high in protein (7-10 grams per serving, depending on flavor), and contain cultures like L. Bulgaricus, L. Acidophilus, and Bifidus to aid in healthy digestion.

When that’s our craving, we reach for Trader Joe’s Nonfat Plain Greek Yogurt.Trader Joe’s Nonfat Plain Greek Yogurt is a standout in the creaminess department – creaminess you expect from the best Greek yogurts – and is made with milk from cows not treated with rBST. Some “Greek-style” yogurts come by their creaminess via thickeners or gums. Not this one. TJ’s Nonfat Plain Greek Yogurt is strained, as tradition dictates, to remove much of the liquid whey, leaving a thicker, creamier yogurt.Our Nonfat Plain Greek Yogurt is also higher in protein than classic, European-style yogurts – each eight ounce serving has 22 grams of protein! Add in some fresh or frozen fruit and a little granola for a hearty breakfast. Add a bit of honey for a satisfying snack. Blend into a smoothie to add a touch of tartness to that sweet treat.

green-goddess-gouda-071172,Green Goddess Gouda," Green goddess began as a salad dressing. Wait, back up. As the story goes, a hotel chef in San Francisco (circa 1923) wanted to pay tribute to his actor friend who was appearing in a play by William Archer called “The Green Goddess.” He concocted a creamy, green-tinted dressing that was to be the inspiration for many dressings to come.   Of course, Trader Joe’s picked up on this with our Green Goddess Dressing and extended that line into the dip category with our Green Goddess Dip. Then we wanted to stretch the concept a bit, so we partnered with a cheese maker in New York to create a cheese that would be exclusive to Trader Joe’s and would include a distinct, green-herby character that could justify its name: Green Goddess Gouda.   This Gouda is actually a blend of two goudas; one milder, and one that’s aged and a bit sharper. The smooth, flavorful cheese base is blended with a pesto (created separately) that includes olive oil, avocado oil, onion powder—and several dried alliums and herbs, such as minced garlic, scallions, chives, basil, and parsley. The result is a herbalicious, smooth & nutty cheese that very tasty on its own. It also melts quite well, so you can put our Green Goddess Gouda on your panini, your burger, or even in your mac and cheese!

turkeyless-ground-073566,Turkeyless Ground," Plant-based protein is all about having options: the option to make a dish that will satisfy meat-eaters and non meat-eaters alike, the option to engage in the occasional meatless Monday, the option to enjoy a juicy burger, regardless of protein preference—we really could go on. So we think it’s only fitting that the scope of plant- based protein itself should be brimming with options, too. In this spirit of plant-based pluralism, we’re proud to introduce Trader Joe’s Turkeyless Ground, a superbly savory protein that evokes the flavor, texture, and with 21 grams per serving, protein content of ground turkey to seriously delicious degree.   Made from a meticulously measured blend of pea protein and textured wheat protein, our Turkeyless Ground is relatively light, lean, and holds onto spices, seasonings, and sauces with aplomb—just like regular ground turkey. That means it’s a particularly smart choice for making dishes like tacos, chili, shepherd’s pie, or spaghetti Bolognese. Since it cooks just like ground turkey, it can be used just like you would ground turkey, in stir fries, lasagnas, stuffed peppers, or hearty soups. And, of course, it also makes a spectacularly juicy burger, especially when seasoned with a bit of Mushroom & Company Umami Seasoning Blend.

If you’re a cauli-minimalist, briefly sauté our Riced Cauliflower in your favorite TJ’s olive oil with a pinch of salt and enjoy as is. To dress it up a bit, top it with Trader Joe’s Tomato Basil Marinara and our Freshly Shaved Parmesan, Romano & Asiago Cheese. Toss it into a curry, a soup, or a stew for some added heartiness.

After that, you’re treated to the tender texture of the ground beef inside, which is seasoned with rich and aromatic spices like curry powder, fenugreek, and cayenne. They’re hearty enough to make either a light meal or filling snack, and, conveniently, can be prepared in the oven, microwave, or air fryer.

instant-boba-kit-073998,Instant Boba Kit," Since its creation in Taiwan in the 1980s, boba has become a genuinely global phenomenon—and if you’re lucky enough to live near a boba shop, you’ll know exactly why.

It’s a taste-texture combo that serves as an ideal anytime treat, especially when combined with a savory snack. And now, thanks to Trader Joe’s Instant Boba Kit, it can be enjoyed from the comforts of your very own home.   For right about the same price you’d pay for a single boba drink at a café, each Boba Kit contains four pouches of tapioca pearls flavored with rich brown sugar, which take only a minute in the microwave to heat up. From there, it’s just a matter of mixing into a glass of your preferred milk or non-dairy alternative, adding ice, and enjoying. Why, we’ve even included a wide-gauge paper straw to go along with each pouch to make sure you can capture a few boba with every sip.

hot-sweet-jalapenos-056688,Hot & Sweet Jalapeños," Most people know the famous tongue twister where Peter Piper picks a peck of pickled peppers. Well, thanks to a palatable new pepper offering, we’ve decided to reword it. “Trader Joe’s picked a peck of Hot & Sweet Jalapeños…” Sounds rather catchy, we think.   The developers of our Hot & Sweet Jalapeños originally came upon a jar of candied jalapeños in Kansas City, Missouri. The concept piqued their interest but the peppers were just a little too sweet. So, for this product they concocted the perfect balance of sweetness to complement—but not overpower—the heat of the jalapeños. And, yes, these are spicy; they’ll certainly pack the punch you’d expect from the small but mighty jalapeño. Grown in Mexico and Canada, the sliced jalapeños are pickled in a concoction of sugar, vinegar, salt, jalapeño puree, garlic, and a whole red chili pepper. The final result? A palatable, perfectly pickled—and sweet—pepper.   Perplexed about how to put our Hot & Sweet Jalapeños to use? Pop ‘em in your mouth like candy. Top a heap- ing plate of nachos with several slices. Spice up a hamburger or grilled cheese. Add to guacamole. Serve with crackers and cream cheese. Place as a pickled accompaniment for charcuterie.

Traditional Biryani is Basmati rice, steamed separately and layered with vegetables and/or meat that have been pan-fried with an intricate blend of aromatic, dry spices.

(Disclaimer: if you add loads of butter, sour cream and bacon to your potatoes, we cannot be held responsible for the ultimate calorie count.)

chiave-d-oro-raw-milk-hard-cheese-074122,Chiave d' Oro Raw Milk Hard Cheese," What’s in a name, you ask? For cheese, a name can mean quite a lot. For instance, the name of our latest entrant into the Spotlight Cheese program, Trader Joe’s Chiave D’Oro, translates from Italian to “golden key.” It’s crafted for us by an acclaimed supplier from California, who named it for its rich, golden color, and for the fact that its uniquely nutty and delicately sweet flavor profile can only be “unlocked,” as it were, by a series of secret, proprietary cheesemaking techniques. Perhaps, by any other name, this Chiave D’Oro would taste just as nutty and sweet — but it wouldn’t be quite as poetic, now, would it?   Made with raw milk and aged a minimum of 6 months, Chiave D’Oro has a firm, toothsome texture and balanced flavor that’s a bit like a Parmesan mixed with a Gouda. In addition to being an excellent standalone snacking cheese, it makes an extraordinary addition to any cheese plate or charcuterie board, and it’s especially delicious when grated and served over salads, soups, or roasted veggies. Looking to pair with a wine? Something big and bold will be key (if you pardon the pun). We reccommend a glass of Liberté Cabernet Sauvignon.

True to form, Trader Joe’s Organic Hickory Smoked Turkey Breast is superb for sandwiches, but its laudable attributes go far beyond the fact that it’s conveniently pre-sliced. Our Organic Turkey Breast is sourced from turkeys that are allowed plenty of space to roam about, and are never fed animal by-products; just a strict, vegetarian diet. And they’re also never given antibiotics, or added hormones. We could stop there... but we won’t! Each thinly sliced piece of Turkey is tender, savory, and has a delicate Hickory smokiness to it that pairs especially well with a nice, sharp Cheddar—like our Organic New Zealand Cheddar, for instance—and even better when that pairing comes together in the form of a warm turkey melt.

corn-and-chile-tomato-less-salsa-079614,Corn and Chile Tomato-less Salsa," Trader Joe’s Corn & Chile Salsa is definitely corny. In a good way. It’s an a-maizing condiment, beginning with a base of sweet corn, and blended with finely diced red bell peppers, onions, jalapeño peppers, and a bit of sugar. By “a base of sweet corn,” we mean, “lots and lots of sweet corn.” As in, 1.8 ears of corn in every jar – we have taken them off their cobs to make them fit. (We’ve sold enough of this salsa that over time, this has added up to more than 41,313,173 ears of corn.) It has a little kick, but it’s not what we’d call hot.   Pile it into tacos or burritos, scoop it up with Organic Corn Dippers, spoon it over salads or chili or soup, use it as a dip for veggies, fold it into scrambled eggs, serve it as a side dish with grilled chicken or fish, or even use it in place of traditional relish on a hot dog.

Grown in Nicaragua, the Maragogype (pronounced ma-ra-go-hee-peh ) coffee bean is considered rare and is known as “elephant bean” on account of its noticeably large size. These beans make a remarkably smooth and gently sweet cup of coffee. They’re given a light roast to draw out a natural sweetness that lends itself to an easy-drinking coffee with notes of honey and caramel. And from the Santa Ana region of El Salvador, the Pacamara (a hybrid of Pacas and Maragogype varietals) bean is grown in volcanic soil. This attribute helps yield full flavors and floral aromas like orange, jasmine, and chocolate that really make this medium roast shine!   Trader Joe’s Select Harvest Curated Coffee 50/50 Blend of El Salvador Pacamara & Nicaragua Maragogype can be ground and brewed to fit your morning coffee routine. It yields a magnificent cup whether you use a drip or pour over method, a French press, or an espresso machine.

Nestled in the southern end of the Salinas Valley, just a stone’s throw from Monterey or Big Sur, SLH’s sunny days and foggy, breezy nights create the ideal environment for growing ripe, juicy grapes with beautifully balanced acidity. These, in turn, go on to create crisp, delectably tropical, easy-drinking wines—just like Trader Joe’s Reserve Santa Lucia Highlands Chardonnay.   Perfect for pairing with creamy pastas, buttery seared scallops, or your favorite funky blue cheese, this light and fruity Chardonnay positively dazzled our tasting panel with its full body and pronounced notes of ripe pear, warm vanilla, and toasted oak.

(In fact, the whole idea of Meritage was effectively invented by California wine-growers as a way to create Bordeaux-style wines without stepping on Bordeaux’s toes, as it were.) To that end, our newest Trader Joe’s Reserve entry, a Meritage from California’s North Coast growing region, is a stellar example: made with a classic Bordeaux blend of grapes, including Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, and Petit Verdot, this beautifully balanced wine has all the backbone and smooth finish you’d want from a grand cru, plus all the fruity, jammy notes you’d want from a California red.   Each sip is rich with flavors of Bing cherries and dark chocolate, with occasional savory bursts of black olive and herbes de Provence throughout. It’s complex, without ever becoming overblown, with a silky-smooth tannic structure that makes it a great pairing option for aged cheeses or a filet mignon smothered in sautéed mushrooms.

After you heat these fully-cooked morsels from frozen—either in the microwave for speed (1-2 minutes), steamed on the stovetop, or pan-fried—you’re immediately treated to the satisfyingly chewy (if steamed or microwaved) or crispy (if pan-fried) wheat-flour wrapper, encasing a tender chicken filling that’s been flavored with the likes of soy sauce and garlic. This filling also includes green onions, cabbage—and of course, Cilantro.   The tantalizing taste makes these Mini Wontons an excellent choice anytime you’re craving a quick, savory snack.

layered-beef-tostada-073330,Layered Beef Tostada," Trader Joe's Layered Beef Tostada takes one toasted flour tortilla (tostada literally means “toasted”), and stacks it with typical taco ingredients, and then another toasted flour tortilla. Between the two tortillas, there’s enchilada sauce and savory ground beef, with seasonings that include cumin, paprika, onion, oregano, and cayenne. There are also whole pinto beans (rather than refried), along with two different kinds of cheese: Cheddar and Monterey Jack. Finally, the top toasted tortilla is itself topped with diced tomatoes, sliced black olives, green onions, and more cheese. Delicious!   Though preparing Trader Joe’s Layered Beef Tostada may not be quite as effortless as cruising through the drive-thru, we can honestly say that it’s really quite easy and fairly fast. Simply preheat your conventional oven to 425°F, remove the packaging, and place the Tostada on a lined baking sheet for 15 to 18 minutes. (If you have an air fryer, you can cut your cook time in half!) Either way, you’ll be rewarded with crispy tortillas, melty cheese, and a whole lotta Tostada flavor!

First and foremost, our Coffee Bean Blast Ice Cream has very low overrun. Overrun, in ice cream speak, is the amount of air that’s whipped into the ice cream – the higher the overrun, the lower quality the ice cream. Because there is so little air in this ice cream, it is thicker, richer and creamier than lesser quality ice creams. And then there’s the flavor. Big WOW here. Some coffee ice creams have a little coffee flavor – some don’t even use actual coffee. Our Coffee Bean Blast Ice Cream features big, bold, intense coffee flavor that comes from brewed Colombian coffee and bits of very finely ground French Roast Colombian coffee beans in every bite.

shea-butter-coconut-oil-hair-mask-061447,Shea Butter & Coconut Oil Hair Mask," “Hair is the richest ornament.” – Martin Luther   Martin Luther may not be the most relevant cultural icon, but, by golly, did he know hair! Just kidding. We’re totally making that up. But we do appreciate his 16th-century sentiment; hair is, or certainly can be, an integral part of one’s identity—one’s ornamental crown, if you will. We’re not fans of the concept of “good” and “bad’ hair days (because who is the arbiter of such things anyhow?), but we do know that certain environmental factors and elective processes (like dying, perming, straightening, etc.) can leave your hair feeling dry, damaged, and/or vulnerable to the elements. And when this is the case, you’ll likely need something a little more intense than regular-old conditioner to bring it back to life — something like Trader Joe’s Hair Mask.   Infused with shea butter, coconut oil, argan oil, Vitamin E, and a variety of fruit extracts (like blackberry, mulberry, currant, and açai), Trader Joe’s Hair Mask is thick, rich, and sure to revive even the dullest of mane. It’s also free of parabens, sodium lauryl sulfate, and phthalates, and it’s never tested on animals. You can use our Hair Mask as frequently or as infrequently as you like — your hair; your call. After shampooing, simply massage it into your hair from roots to ends (concentrating on the ends rather than the roots if your hair is fine or oily), leave it in for 3 to 5 minutes, then rinse. The coconut-vanilla scent and touchably-soft silkiness will linger, but a heavy, greasy residue will not. Trust us, you’re going to love this stuff.

brookie-061281,Brookie," Made for us by an Ohio baker with a reputation for brownie brilliance, Trader Joe’s Brookie is a mouth- watering mash-up of two timeless desserts. The bottom layer is all brownie—a rich dark brown batter, with sweetly fragrant cocoa notes and a pleasantly fudgy chew. That beautiful brownie batter is topped with a layer of golden cookie batter that’s speckled with sweet chocolate chips, and the whole thing is baked to perfection—in this case, perfection is defined as a slightly soft, tender center with a gloriously chewy edge. And because this rectangular bar of Brookie goodness is conveniently pre-cut into eight servings, you’ll get a sweet, soft center and chewy edge, no matter which piece you eat.   Speaking of eating, Trader Joe’s Brookie is a two-in-one treat that can fly solo as a sweet snack, or share the limelight warmed up, alongside a simple scoop of TJ’s Super Premium French Vanilla Ice Cream — no glitter required.

peonies-5-stems-041580,Peonies - 5 Stems," Peonies are a much sought after seasonal flower, native to Europe, Asia and western North America. They are prized for their flowers that start in a tight golf-ball shape and open into a showy blossom. Do not worry if they look small or rough when they arrive- the exposed outer petals always have a rough appearance and are the guard petals that protect the flower from the outside elements. Peony flowers grow in several forms: single, semi-double, double and Japanese (also known as anemone-form), and in a range of colors including white, pink, purple, and red.   Trader Joe’s 5-stem Peonies are grown regionally across the country in cool, temperate climates, from the Pacific Northwest to Wisconsin to coastal North Carolina.

As part of the fermentation process, the vintner leaves the juice in contact with the dark-hued Pinot grape skins just long enough to impart a gentle pink color and provide a slight uptick in tannic structure. Combine that with the wine’s naturally berry-and-citrus-forward flavor profile and crisp, clean finish, and you’ve got yourself a Rosé that’s practically tailor-made for slow sipping during a golden, summer sunset.   We’re especially big fans of this Rosé when it’s paired up with rich, buttery seafood, like our Argentinian Red Shrimp with Ginger Garlic Butter & Togarashi Style Seasoning or a Salmon Burger dressed with Truffle Aioli.

As for what goes in them, it’s simple: 100% Ground Beef that is 80% Lean and 20% Fat. We’ve discovered this is just the right ratio to produce a juicy, flavorful burger.   Each package is approximately one pound and contains four pre-formed Beef Patties. We like to warm up a cast-iron frying pan over medium heat with a pad of butter in the center. When the butter melts, briefly toast four TJ’s Hamburger Buns and set aside. Add more butter, and sprinkle your Patties with salt and pepper before placing in the hot pan—if there’s no sizzle, turn up the heat! About three minutes per side should get you to about medium-rare. That’s six minutes per burger, and about ten minutes total for a super-fast, family meal!

After a brisk three to four minutes in boiling water, they take on a delightful al dente texture and can be served as simply (with a splash of olive oil and a pinch of crushed red pepper) or as sauce-fully (tossed with warm Vegan Kale, Cashew & Basil Pesto, for instance) as you’d like.

The result is a snack that has a certain air of sophistication to it, but still stays true to its fun, familiar origins.   With their lush, truffle-forward aromas and one-two punch of umami and Parmesan flavor, our Fancy Cheese Crunchies are a natural fit for dinner parties and cocktail hours that straddle the line of swanky and spontaneous.

espada-pequena-mezcal-063610,Espada Pequeña Mezcal," With its distinctively smoky character and hints of sweet agave, it’s no wonder that mezcal has quite a following. We decided the time was right to bring in our own, and went straight to the source: a distillery in the state of Oaxaca, Mexico that performs every step of the processing, from the growing and harvesting of the agave, to the roasting and fermenting, and even the bottling, on-site. When they’re done, they call it Espada Pequeña Mezcal, the newest addition to our spirits section.   To understand this Mezcal’s appeal, it helps to know a little how it’s made. First, our distillery partner takes their estate-grown agave and roasts it in conical, underground pits, a process which both releases the agave nectar from the plant and gives it its signature smoky notes (tequila, which is technically a kind of mezcal, has a similar process, but uses above-ground brick ovens for roasting, which results in far less smoke in the finished product). Then, their head mezcalero, a third-generation mezcal distiller, ferments the nectar using traditional methods passed down through the decades. The result is a sublimely smoky Mezcal, slightly sweet, a little green and savory, and with a satisfyingly citric edge. It’s marvelously full-flavored when served straight up, and brings a tantalizingly smoky earthiness when mixed into cocktails.

organic-red-wine-vinegar-071254,Organic Red Wine Vinegar," Since time immemorial, pretty much any culture that developed any kind of wine acquired a taste for vinegar shortly thereafter. This is particularly true of the Mediterranean region, where grape-derived vinegars became a staple of cuisines across Egypt, Greece, and Rome thousands of years ago, and remain so to this day. With Trader Joe’s Organic Red Wine Vinegar, we proudly carry on this ancient culinary tradition with a tart, fruity vinegar from Italy, which our supplier makes from organic red wine, then brings to an acidity level of 5% — ideal for bringing out a bright, cheek-tickling sharpness to salad dressings, sauces, and dishes of all kinds.

Search no further, your quest is complete—it’s Buttermilk! This cultured dairy product makes a magnificent marinade, as the acidity in the Buttermilk will tenderize the chicken, allowing it to retain more of its juices when cooking. But this marinade’s magic isn’t instantaneous—it’s best to let the Chicken marinate for an extended period of time to thoroughly season the chicken outside-in.   What about dinner tonight, you ask? Perhaps, your taste buds have been tantalized by the sound of such terrifically tender Chicken that your mouth is watering now. Well, you’re in luck—the wizards behind Trader Joe’s Buttermilk Brined Half Chicken make that dinner-tonight dream a reality.

portuguese-custard-tarts-069352,Portuguese Custard Tarts,"As the old cliché goes, necessity is the mother of invention, but there’s something to be said about the parental capabilities of simple practicality, too. For example: a few centuries back, monks and nuns in Portugal began using egg whites to starch their habits, which created a real surplus of egg yolks within monasteries. Rather than let them go to waste, they began developing yolk-centered desserts, the most successful of which came to be known as pastel de nata, or, as its known throughout the rest of the world, the Portuguese Custard Tart.
 
 While our Custard Tarts may come from less purely practical origins, they are imported from Portugal and prominently feature the same creamy texture and flaky, melt-in-your-mouth crust that have made this dessert a favorite in bakeries the world over. Preparation is as simple as 20 minutes in the oven, 15 in the air fryer, or 55 seconds for a single Tart in the microwave. Once hot and ready, they’re especially delicious when sprinkled with a bit of cinnamon and paired with a steaming cup of coffee or tea. Speaking of practical, our spring- seasonal Trader Joe’s Portuguese Custard Tarts are sure to practically fly out of our freezers, so be sure to pick up a box (contains four Tarts) while supplies last.","['Food', 'From The Freezer', 'Cool Desserts']",https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/portuguese-custard-tarts-069352,$2.99,7.05 Oz,https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m20604/69352.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280,,[],"CONTAINS MILK, EGG, WHEAT.","['Treat Yourself', 'Unexpected']","['4 tarts(200g)', '4 tarts(200g)']","['130 ', '540 ']"

That, plus a crowning layer of whipped cream, is the formula we follow with Trader Joe’s Tres Leches Cake, a quick, convenient, thaw-and-serve tribute to this classic confection.   Sweet, soft, and refreshing with every dairy-saturated bite, our Tres Leches Cake comes frozen and only requires a few hours resting at room temperature (or an overnight stay in your refrigerator) before it’s ready to serve. We find that it makes an ideal dessert option for the spring holidays, especially when adorned with slices of your favorite fresh fruit, or even just a quick sprinkling of cinnamon powder.

Case in point: Trader Joe’s Organic Vegan Nacho Dip.

Equally delicious when enjoyed as snack, sauce, or spread, our Organic Vegan Nacho Dip can be enjoyed straight out of the fridge with your favorite tortilla chip, cracker, or crudité, but we like it even better after it’s been warmed in the microwave for a minute or so. It can be used to make your own dairy-free nachos at home by simply melting and pouring the contents over a plate of Truly Tortilla White Corn Tortilla Chips and sliced jalapeños, or as a condiment for other dishes.

organic-elote-corn-chip-dippers-060564,Organic Elote Corn Chip Dippers," Throughout Mexico and in cities across the U.S., street vendors sell mouthwatering, well-seasoned corn on the cob known as elote. While the fixins may vary from vendor to vendor, elotes typically come slathered in mayo or a crema-based sauce, rolled in grated cotija or añejo cheese, dusted with chili powder, and squirted with lime juice. As anyone who grew up visiting the neighborhood elotero (or making elotes at home) can tell you, it’s a highly craveable combination of flavors that’s sure to leave an impression. It’s left such an impression on us, in fact, that it inspired our exclusive-to-TJ’s snack: Trader Joe’s Organic Elote Corn Chip Dippers.   Elotes are already pretty darn portable (they’re usually served on a stick), but these Organic Elote Corn Chip Dippers take elote-portability to the next level. Now you can enjoy all of that corny, creamy, spiced elote flavor… in a chip! And in a Trader Joe’s Organic Corn Chip Dipper, at that — our original Dippers have been a Customer & Crew favorite for years. With a hint of chipotle, a kick of smoky heat, and a bit of buttermilk-y tang, these Chips have loads of flavor on their own, but they’re perfect for plunging into guacamole or a chunky salsa.

Mac & Cheese, another American favorite, is beloved not so much for its terroir (after all, it is made all over the place!), but more for its concept.

peony-tulips-bunch-066115,Peony Tulips Bunch," A Customer and Crew favorite at Trader Joe’s, the peony is a spectacular floral feat, boasting some of the most beautiful blooms in the plant kingdom. Part of their allure is their limited availability; our Buyer travels far and wide to wrangle enough peonies to fill our stores every spring. Last year, on vendor visit to solidify a peony purchase (consider them wrangled!), she was presented with an additional offer that she simply couldn’t refuse: a large lot of Peony Tulips at an exceptional price, to be grown exclusively for Trader Joe’s.   Unlike their name might suggest, Peony Tulips aren’t actually hybrids—they’re tulips named for their striking resemblance to the bursting bloom of the prized peony. Rather than the single layer of petals you’d find on a standard tulip, Peony Tulips, which are also called as Double Tulips, have multiple layers of sweetly scented petals, creating a dazzling, ruffled effect. They grow in an array of vibrant hues (pinks, yellows, purples, oranges, reds, whites, etc.) and boast equally exotic varietal names, like “Endless Love,” “Margarita,” and “Cilesta.” And thanks to their hardy character, these long-lasting Peony Tulips will remain flashy and fabulous for up to 7 days after you put them in water!

But that’s not the only way these cows are coddled. Their farmer—who oversees an idyllic estate in the picturesque Twente region of The Netherlands—gives his bovines carte blanche to roam, from stable to clover-laden fields. Content cows supply marvelous milk, which yields exceptional cheese. Of course, the farmer’s authentic recipe and artisanal methods don’t hurt, either!   We could stop at great Gouda, but there’s more… This fresh-made cheese is hand-washed in caramel—yes, caramel! As the curds mature over the next five months, the rind develops an appealing, chestnut-brown color. Meanwhile, on the inside, the aging cheese absorbs some of the caramel character, producing a mildly sweet flavor.

decaf-french-roast-instant-coffee-071954,Decaf French Roast Instant Coffee," Fixing up that first cup of coffee is often an essential part of the morning routine. For many, in fact, it’s what marks the actual beginning of the day. But when time is in short supply, it can be quite a challenge to get that routine up and running — doubly so if you prefer to drink decaf. That’s why Trader Joe’s Decaf French Roast Instant Coffee is so handy: all it takes is a cup of hot water and a second or two of stirring to start your morning (or whenever you take your decaf) with all the rich aromas and dark, toasty flavors of a classic cup of French roast — minus the caffeine, of course.   With a just-like-fresh-brewed flavor that must be tasted to be believed, our Decaf French Roast Instant Coffee doesn’t just save you time, it’s also a tremendous help when traveling, camping, or in any other circumstance where you won’t have immediate access to a coffee machine. And since it’s decidedly decaffeinated, it makes a great option for serving with dessert (especially when paired up with something like a Chocolate Lava Cake. We even find it makes a great ingredient in a dessert: try using an egg beater to mix a tablespoon or two with equal parts sugar and water until fluffy, then serving atop a glass of chilled milk for an easy decaf dalgona coffee.

when-life-gives-you-lemons-make-ice-cream-074092,When Life Gives You Lemons Make Ice Cream," Is there a fruit that gets a worse rap, rhetorically, than the humble lemon? In addition to being used to refer to defective devices and automobiles, it’s featured prominently (and rather pejoratively) in an age-old adage about making the best of a bad situation — simply because it’s sour! Well, we’ve had enough of such citric slander. In response, we’re introducing Trader Joe’s When Life Gives You Lemons, Make Ice Cream, a sweet, creamy, and delightfully tart frozen treat to serve as the seasonal celebration that lemons so richly deserve.       Unlike the idiom that inspired its name, When Life Gives You Lemons is an example of making a great situation even better. Starting with a base of sweet, velvety ice cream that’s been flavored with lemon juice and lemon zest, our supplier mixes in bits of buttery shortbread cookies to provide some textural contrast, then adds a bright yellow lemon swirl for even more citrus-y zing. Every spoonful is tart and sweet without ever becoming sharp or cloying, and with just enough toothsomeness from the shortbread bits to keep the palate engaged. It makes an excellent ice cream for scooping into a cone on a warm spring day, or for constructing superbly sweet and sour sundaes.

gyro-slices-055277,Gyro Slices," While we thoroughly enjoy a gyro out, there are definitely times we just want to gyro in—cozying up with the richly seasoned strips of beef or lamb, enfolded in a flatbread with tomatoes, red onions, and a seductive dollop of creamy, cucumber-y tzatziki—mmm. Our obstacle: cooking gyro (say: “YEE-ro”) meat is no joke.   Just consider the presumed roots of this dish, back to the time of Alexander the Great, when soldiers used their long swords to skewer meat, which they arduously rotated over open fires. Cooking methods may have modern- ized (a bit), but bottom line—it’s an intense process. Luckily, we are in the business of banishing barriers to truly tender, savory meat. Enter: Trader Joe’s Gyro Slices.   Traveling to Chicago—a hotbed of gyro production—we sought out masters of this Mediterranean-style meat. The midwest meat mavins we found, expertly season their fusion of ground beef, breadcrumbs, and lamb, with garlic, oregano, and lemon. Then, they rotate and roast it until it yields. Lastly, they slice it thin, as though on a swords edge, so the meat remains supple, with edges that crisp when heated.   Our Fully Cooked Gyro Slices come ready to heat and dish. While the flatbread wrap is a natural fit (traditional recipe is on the package), it’s also delectable on a Mediterranean pizza or salad. And diced into an omelet with sundried tomatoes and crumbly feta... mmm, again.

Which is precisely why we carry Trader Joe’s Chickenless Crispy Tenders in our freezers. They’re made from a mix of soy and whole grains, and are breaded and fried to perfection before being flash-frozen for ease of preparation at home. Now, those who don’t eat meat don’t have to miss out on all the savory flavor and satisfyingly crisp texture of a classic tender or nugget.After just a few minutes in the oven, air fryer, or skillet, these Tenders take on a delightfully golden brown hue and become ready to dunk in your favorite dipping sauce. But that’s hardly where we’d stop: They also make a great protein for a vegan version of a crispy chicken sandwich, a top-notch topping for salads when roughly chopped, and a delightful, plant-based substitute for boneless (not to mention the rest-of-the-Chickenless) wings when dipped into a mixture of Peri Peri Sauce and melted Vegan Buttery Spread.

Ladies and gentlefolks, from the skincare-centric minds that brought you Trader Joe’s Antioxidant Facial Serum and Trader Joe’s Hyaluronic Moisture Boost Serum, we present Trader Joe’s Retinol Night Serum with Baobab Seed Oil.   In simplest terms, our dermatologist-formulated Retinol Night Serum acts as an exfoliant, sloughing off dead skin cells as you sleep, to reveal a revitalized you come morning. Included in a carefully selected 0.3% concentration, Retinol (vitamin A) is clearly the Serum’s star player, but if you take a peek at its ingredients, you’ll find an impressive supporting cast, too — skincare superheroes like sodium hyaluronate, vitamins C & E, salicylic acid, and, of course, skin-soothing Baobab Seed Oil.   Whether you’re a retinol rookie or a seasoned pro, we think you’ll be over the moon for this midnight miracle. For best results, we suggest incorporating this new step into your skincare routine slowly — start by applying it once or twice a week, as your skin tolerates it, followed by a generous layer of your favorite TJ’s moisturizer. And remember: chemical exfoliants like retinol can increase photosensitivity, so be sure to apply a broad spectrum sunscreen daily. Sweet dreams!

Originally served in soy sauce, tteok bok ki took on its modern- day red hue and sweet, peppery flavor profile via one chef ’s introduction of gochujang sauce in the mid-20th century, and has since become a darling of Korean BBQ connoisseurs and street food aficionados the world over. And now, this rich, spicy delicacy of rather royal origins has found a new domain: The freezer aisle at your neighborhood Trader Joe’s. Make way for Trader Joe’s Tteok Bok Ki!

Equally delicious as an appetizer, snack, or meal, especially when topped with a fried egg or freshly grilled Short Ribs. They can be prepared in a more traditional manner, by boiling the rice cakes in water, adding the sauce, and simmering until thick, or made extra crispy by giving them a turn in the skillet or air fryer prior to incorporating the sauce. In either case, they’ll have a delightfully chewy, almost mochi-like texture, and a bold, peppery heat which pairs well with an ice-cold soju or frosted glass of PLZNR Czech Style Lager.

egg-wraps-073420,Egg Wraps," Recreating the feeling of a soft, warm tortilla or flatbread can be a difficult thing to do without gluten (trust us, we’ve tried a lot of variations in the Trader Joe’s test kitchen), but fortunately for all of us, our expert suppliers are on the case! Their dedication to delicate, low-carb creperie has resulted in our latest innovation, Trader Joe’s Egg Wraps. Using the power of eggs combined with a carefully balanced blend of gluten free flours, including brown rice flour, millet flour, and potato starch, each mildly savory Wrap provides all the structure, flexibility, and tender texture of a classic tortilla, and a scant fraction of the carbs — a 60-calorie serving of two Wraps will contain zero net carbs, in fact!   Use our Egg Wraps in any application you would a tortilla or flatbread: you can roll them with turkey and cheese and slice them for an effortless, classic appetizer, for instance.

Not only does this mean they are gluten free, it also makes them wonderfully crunchy.

Trader Joe’s Wild Arugula contains a particular cultivar of arugula with an even more pronounced peppery taste, which arrives to use triple-washed and ready to use for all sorts of situations.   For starters, it makes an excellent salad green (why not do as the Romans do, after all?), espeically when paired up with a hearty protein like roasted chicken or grilled shrimp. We also like the soft, yet subtly snappy texture our Wild Arugula adds to sandwiches and hamburgers. It’s been known to add a bit of visual flare and textural variety on top of fresh-from-the-oven pizzas, and can even be used to make an out-of-this-world, peppery pesto — we even provide a great, easy recipe for the latter on the back of the package.

Toasty and aromatic, Jasper Hill Vault No. 5 Cave Aged Cheese was inspired by Swiss and Italian mountain cheeses—delightfully creamy, toasty and savory, with subtle earthy notes. It’s cave aged for a minimum of one year, a process that allows a natural rind to form around its golden, straw colored paste. In short, it’s the stuff cheesy dreams are made of.   Let this Cave Aged Cheese warm to room temperature, and you’ll be rewarded as its dense, pliant texture gives way to an ultra-buttery mouthfeel with each bite. If you manage not to eat all of it right off the cheese board—and we wouldn’t blame you if you did—try it melted on a grilled cheese sandwich or burger.

First, we recommend scooping it out, placing it in a freezer-safe sandwich bag, then squeezing as much air out as you can before sealing and placing in the freezer.

Just like its namesake pepper, Trader Joe’s Guajillo Salsa makes a remarkably versatile addition to any pantry. It makes a great first course for taco night when enjoyed with tortilla chips, an ideal condiment for tacos, burritos, and fajitas, and even an excellent ingredient in chilis, soups, and queso dips.

rosemary-croissant-croutons-072051,Rosemary Croissant Croutons," Consider, for a moment, the crouton. Perhaps you haven’t given croutons much thought in the past — an entirely understandable position to be in, given that they’re hardly ever the focus of a meal. As purveyors (and appreciators) of food in all its forms, however, we decided to spend some time contemplating their place on the plate, and when we were done, we found that these crunchy toppers of soups and salads had a tremendous amount of untapped potential. For example, what if, instead of a standard loaf of bread, they were made from a buttery, flaky, luxuriously multi-layered croissant? And what if you added an alluringly aromatic herb, like rosemary, to the mix? Shortly after, Trader Joe’s Rosemary Croissant Croutons were born.   Truly a breakthrough for the medium, these Rosemary Croissant Croutons take everything about a classic crouton to the next level. The nature of the dough they’re made from results in a remarkably resounding crunch. The satisfyingly savory flavor of the rosemary synergizes spectacularly with everything from creamy Caesar salads to zesty tomato bisques or even hearty, homemade French onion soups. But that’s hardly all — they’re also great when crushed coarsely and used as a topping for scalloped potatoes or a breading for a juicy pork cutlet. And as long we’re considering croutons in general, feel free to consider Trader Joe’s Rosemary Croissant Croutons a decidedly delicious snack in their own right.

These burgers are, more or less, a blend of the two.   With multi-hued quinoa (red, white, and black) setting the stage, black beans, corn, red peppers, and plenty of seasonings are blended together and formed into a burger patty. They cook up to a captivatingly chewy consistency, with just the right amount of crunch on the outside (not so crunchy if you cook them in the mi- crowave). They work on a bun, like any other burger—ratchet up their Southwestern vibe with the addition of sliced avocado and salsa instead of the usual pickles and ketchup.

But the truth is, it’s actually a garlic bread cheese, inspired by the Finnish delicacy that just happens, by idiomatic coincidence, to pair wonderfully with garlic. It’s crafted for us by master cheesemakers in Wisconsin, who take blocks of rich, thick, cow’s milk cheese, cover them in garlic powder, then bake them to a beautifully golden-brown hue. 
 
 Known in its native Finland as juustolepä, Bread Cheese contains no wheat, or gluten, nor anything else of that nature, but rather gets its name from its hearty, remarkably bread-like consistency and squeaky, Halloumi-like texture. And much like Halloumi, Trader Joe’s Garlic Bread Cheese is best served nice and warm, after it’s had a chance to get just a little melty and gooey. Fun fact: in Finland, Bread Cheese is typically eaten in the morning, dunked in coffee.

organic-balsamic-vinegar-071253,Organic Balsamic Vinegar," In the Emilia-Romagna region of northern Italy, the city of Modena is famous for an Italian opera legend and iconic, luxury sports cars; it’s also home to Aceto Balsamico di Modena. Prized for its wooden barrel aging process and rich, complex flavor, all vinegar produced in this region bears a seal of authenticity, in this case, IGP (Protected Geographical Indication) to help protect shoppers against lower quality, imitation products—a seal you can find on all Trader Joe’s seasonal and everyday offerings of balsamico.

But now, we’ve delivered the flavor of this traditional sauce in an unexpected form: ravioli!   Trader Joe’s Cacio e Pepe Ravioli is just what you’d imagine if you know the sauce. Our Italian supplier makes girasoli pasta (literally “sunflower” pasta) from durum wheat semolina and includes coarsely ground black pepper in the dough. They worked hard at finding the right grind—large enough to crunch, but not so coarse that it ripped through the rolled out dough. The sun-shaped pockets are filled with a creamy mixture that includes ricotta cheese, cream, and PDO Pecorino Romano. In fact, they whip these ingredients together to ensure a smooth and soft filling.

calrose-rice-070185,Calrose Rice," So much depends upon the length of a grain of rice. Though it may sound trivial, the textural difference just between long and medium grain rice is a whole other world, culinarily speaking. Whereas long-grained varietals like Jasmine and Basmati tend to have a drier, more individualized texture, like you’d find in a typical fried rice dish, medium-grained rice tends to be a little closer and stickier, like what you’d expect to find in risotto or paella. Trader Joe’s Calrose Rice is a classic example of the latter. Once cooked, it’s elegantly soft and fluffy, and holds onto flavors with ease — the perfect rice for poke or teriyaki bowls, and just the thing to round out our rice selection.   First developed in California in the late 1940s, Calrose Rice has since become one of the more popular rice varietals in the world, and by far the most widely grown varietal in California. After tasting it, it’s easy to see why: with its mild flavor and sticky texture, it takes on sauces and seasonings beautifully, without sacrificing any of its satisfying starchiness. Try it out with our classic Mandarin Orange Chicken and you’ll see exactly what we mean.

For these reasons, we sought out a kale supplier who could bring us the best of kale, minus the unpleasant stems.

Made for us by an expert cheesemaker in Wisconsin, this Truffle Burrata uses the contrasts of its constituent ingredients to great effect, with each opposing aspect accentuating the other. The fresh mozzarella’s soft chewiness heightens the richness of the cream inside, which in turn is enhanced by the umami notes of the black summer truffle mixed within. It makes an excellent appetizer or side dish, especially when served with pasta or pizza, and even tastes amazing when melted directly onto of a wood-fired pizza, itself.

Our supplier marinates these quartered artichoke hearts in a flavorful mix of olive oil, vinegar, garlic, thyme, basil, and lime zest, then drains them and packs them in a pouch so they can be enjoyed anywhere and everywhere that snacking is allowed.   Of course, their portable properties are only part of the solution: with these, you get all the benefits of tender, savory, Marinated Artichokes, and none of the residual oil or mess on your fingers. They make a great addition to school and office lunches, can be used to top salads, sandwiches, and pizzas, and at only 15 calories per serving, they’re an apt alternative to crackers or chips.

While Magnifisauce has a kind of relish-y profile, Incredisauce is more like honey-mustard. Mustard is blended with egg yolks, garlic and onion powders, cane sugar, lemon juice, and a hint of natural smoke flavor. The resulting sauce is golden-yellow, with a thick and creamy texture, and a super balance of tangy and sweet flavors, with just a hint of smokiness.

In fact, as the constituent members of Trader Joe’s Root Vegetable Fries demonstrate, there’s a whole world of root veggies out there that fit the bill. Inside each 16-ounce bag, our supplier from Italy has assembled a mouthwatering medley of roasted sweet potatoes, carrots, beets, and parsnips, that not only deliver on the crisp exterior and tender interior of a slender-cut French fry, but also add their inherent earthy sweetness into every bite.   With just a few minutes in the oven or air fryer, these Root Vegetable Fries transform into an effortlessly elevated appetizer or accessory to burgers, steaks, or any number of savory entrées. They take particularly well to being modified with seasonings and spices, allowing you a large amount of leeway to experiment: try sprinkling generously with some of our Mushroom & Company, Ajika, or even some Cheesy Seasoning Blend for even more flavor. And, like any good fry, they’re especially amenable to dipping in ketchups, barbecue sauces, or special spreads like our Magnifisauce.

Trader Joe’s Organic Fusilli Corti Bucati Pasta is one such majestic macaroni. What makes this noodle noteworthy? It starts with the Italian pasta maker sourcing high quality, organic, and local durum wheat semolina, then going the extra mile to mill the flour themselves. High quality tools are equally essential —bronze coated shaping disks are used to produce thick, textured noodles that deliver a perfectly al dente texture that help support the heftiness of its partnered sauce while maintaining a delicate chew.   You may be familiar with Fusilli—the spirals that have filled our shelves and stomachs for years. But these Fusilli are distinctly different. In Italian, “Corti” means short and “Bucati” translates to “with a hole”. Each bite-size noodle is corkscrew shaped, with a hollow center that makes for an immensely exciting eating experience. Pair it with a hearty Bolognese sauce and be in awe of how much sauce clings to each noodle, while never feeling weighed down. Serve it hot or cold, in a vegetable soup, a pasta salad, or with your favorite TJ’s pasta sauce.

They're made with beef and cheese, to match the flavor of a freshly grilled cheeseburger patty, and a grain-free blend of chickpeas and tapioca starch to provide the feeling of a tender-baked bun.   Suitable for dogs of all ages and sizes, these Treats are great for training motivation, presenting on special occasions, or simply handing out when your pooch is being especially cute (i.e., anytime at all). And since they're Grain Free, they're designed to be especially soft on your pooch's stomach, too.

apple-each-opal-052688,APPLE EACH OPAL," “What’s so special about an Opal?” you might ask. You might also be asking, “What is an Opal?” Thankfully, we’re here to answer both questions. An Opal is a specialty variety of apple, a cross between Golden Delicious and Topaz that’s grown in the fertile farmland of eastern Washington, near the crystal-clear waters of the Snake River. An edible orb of sunshine, its bright yellow skin is mottled with natural russeting at the stem; the crisp flesh beneath boasts a sweet, tangy flavor and a seriously satisfying crunch.   Enticingly sweet flavor and craveably crunchy texture aside, what’s special about these precious pommes is their natural resistance to browning when cut. What that means for you is that you can cut them up and serve them in a salad—no browning. You can slice them and add them to a lunchbox—no browning. You can present wedges on a cheese tray—no browning. This makes them almost as appealing when cut as they are when left whole. Almost.

glazed-sour-cream-donuts-065569,Glazed Sour Cream Donuts," There’s plenty of squabble over who exactly “invented” the donut. One of the more amusing origin stories we’ve come across traces it back to an American sea Captain Hanson Gregory. The story goes that, on a particularly choppy voyage, Capt. Gregory saw no reason he shouldn’t be able to steer his ship with both his hands and enjoy his favorite baked good at the same time—so he impaled the round, cake-like creation on his steering wheel. You know, like any logical sea Captain would. While we can’t say whether that’s fact or fiction, we can whole-heartedly empathize with Capt. Gregory’s extreme donut devotion. We, too, are known to sail the (culinary) seas, and we, too, LOVE donuts.   Trader Joe’s Glazed Sour Cream Donuts. are made for us by a family-owned, New England bakery and are the donuts of our dreams.

However, our recipe includes sea salt and celery powder, which contain naturally occurring nitrites.   This is thickly sliced bacon that’s appropriate with eggs for breakfast, with lettuce and tomatoes for a BLT, in wraps, on salads... You can cook it as you’d cook any bacon, though our current favorite cooking method involves cooking on a foil-lined baking sheet in a 400° oven for about 15 minutes – this nets the most delicious result.

It’s crafted with part-skim cow’s milk, the fresh product of eight village creameries in the Swiss region of origin. Once made, the petite, cylindrical wheels of cheese are matured on spruce wood boards for at least two-and-a-half months. Now, here’s where it gets really interesting: Each wheel is centered on a steel post so it may rotate while a very sharp cutting tool is dragged along the surface of the cheese. The result is super-thin and long slices that naturally curl as they are cut, forming what resembles a delicate rose.   In addition to the intriguing look of these Rosettes, the increased surface area that comes in contact with the air changes the structure of the cheese, allowing its aromatic character to develop to the fullest. When popped in your mouth, the silky, ivory-colored, flower-shaped Cheese literally melts, creating a cheese-eating experience like no other!

Complex and full-bodied, with a lively acidic backbone and graceful notes of blackberry and plum, it delivers a delectably robust and fruit-forward profile, while still maintaining an approachable air of delicacy, thanks in large part to its velvety soft tannins. It makes an ideal introduction to Pinot Noir for any fine wine neophyte, as well a dependable year-end staple for longtime wine lovers. And just as an ideal Pinot Noir should be, our Carneros Grand Reserve is very versatile when it comes to food pairing. Enjoy some with appetizers, like Brie En Croûte or Fried Olive Bites. As far as mains go, we find it goes exceptionally well with duck, turkey, or pork, and can even stand up to red meat, like our Porcini Beef Loin Roast.

It’s a glittering yellow sparkler made with grapes from globally-recognized growing regions in California’s North Coast, where cool, coastal weather allows for longer growing seasons. This in turn results in more concentrated, complex flavors in the Wine — specifically, golden apple, ripe pear, and hints of toasted brioche — balanced with a soft, refreshing finish.   Another positive in the pedigree column? This beautiful Brut is produced using Méthode Champenoise techniques, providing a Champagne-level experience without the accompanying price tag.

protein-patties-065240,Protein Patties,"It may seem far outside the ordinary, implausible, even, but plant-based burgers have become one of the most popular food trends of the past few years, and there's no sign of slowing down. Folks are increasingly going for meatless burgers for all kinds of reasons, but we like to think that one reason in particular is primarily responsible: plant-based burgers have gotten really, really good recently. That's why we decided to bring in our very own Trader Joe's Protein Patties, a pair of pea protein-based, quarter-pound burger Patties that offer the flavor and texture of a traditional beef hamburger, but with none of the meat - or any other animal-based ingredients, for that matter.
 
 Throw these Protein Patties on the grill or in a hot skillet, and they'll sizzle and brown, just like a traditional burger. Serve them warm on a toasty bun and take a bite, and you'll experience their satisfyingly savory flavor and marvellously meaty texture, just like in a traditional burger.

No matter which you make, the Mini Chocolate Chips will become marvelously melty as their prepared, creating a wonderful mix of textures and flavors with every bite.

(Modern business lingo calls this type of operation vertically integrated; we just call it very intelligent.) Where many instant coffees are freeze dried, our 100% Colombian Instant Coffee is agglomerated, which literally means “formed into a round ball.” In this case, it specifically means that the beans are granulated using a steam-heat process, which makes the coffee incredibly soluble; a heaping teaspoon dissolves quickly and easily into a cup of hot water—no stubborn granules left behind.

It’s almost impossible to cut almonds into slivers this regular and uniform at home, using regular kitchen tools, which makes our Slivered Almonds all the more convenient. That’s all the more important, considering that their shape not only looks great when placed atop a cookie, bowl of oatmeal, or salad, but also nicely accentuates their texture and flavor.

This vibrant salad accompaniment is packed with Hass avocados, fresh herbs like basil, and chives, and seasonings that include green onions, garlic, and apple cider vinegar. Most refrigerated dressings are heat pasteurized for safety. That’s great for safety; not so great for maintaining the fresh flavors of otherwise raw foods.

organic-crumbled-feta-cheese-062632,Organic Crumbled Feta Cheese," While traditional feta is made with sheep’s milk, our Organic Crumbled Feta is made in Wisconsin with organic, rBST-free cow’s milk. The cow’s milk offers a milder flavor than sheep’s milk, while retaining the pleasant tanginess so favored by feta fans. The curds are bathed in a salty brine (think of it as “pickling” but with cheese!), then drained, gently pressed and dried to allow the saltiness to infuse throughout. This process creates a buttery tanginess and a slightly firm texture that crumbles with ease. Crumbly, briny Cheese made with organic milk? Be still our palates!   Although a handful of Crumbled Feta atop a crisp romaine salad is a wonderful thing, there’s an endless number of ways to enjoy its salty goodness outside of leafy greens. Stir it into rigatoni with sausage, white beans, and kale. Mix it with TJ’s Fresh Bruschetta Sauce and Steamed Lentils for a quick cracker dip.

eggwich-breadless-breakfast-sandwich-070784,Eggwich Breadless Breakfast Sandwich," This ingenious twist on a classic formula starts with an old-fashioned base of turkey sausage topped with American cheese, but replaces the bread with two soft-yet-sturdy scrambled egg patties, creating a breakfast sandwich experience that’s packed with protein, gluten free, lighter on carbs, and has everything you need to start your day off on a decidedly delicious note.    Each Eggwich comes fully cooked and ready to reheat from frozen, which only takes about two minutes in the microwave. Once heated through (and given a moment to cool), the cheese becomes marvelously melty, the turkey sausage takes on a crisp, yet yielding, texture, and the egg patties become fantastically fluffy, while still maintaining enough structure to act as handholds. If that weren’t enough, every Eggwich is consciously crafted to contain a whopping sixteen grams of protein, but only three grams of carbohydrates. Now that’s a golden ratio, if we’ve ever heard of one.

These burgers are, more or less, a blend of the two.   With multi-hued quinoa (red, white, and black) setting the stage, black beans, corn, red peppers, and plenty of seasonings are blended together and formed into a burger patty. They cook up to a captivatingly chewy consistency, with just the right amount of crunch on the outside (not so crunchy if you cook them in the mi- crowave). They work on a bun, like any other burger—ratchet up their Southwestern vibe with the addition of sliced avocado and salsa instead of the usual pickles and ketchup. Break them up into salads—a simple dress- ing of salsa verde will do the trick here. Or just serve with a knife and fork and your favorite fixin’s.

garlic-bread-cheese-071622,Garlic Bread Cheese,"Given our fondness for food mashups, you might assume that Trader Joe’s Garlic Bread Cheese is a garlic bread cheese — as in, a cheese flavored like the popular side dish for pizzas and pastas. But the truth is, it’s actually a garlic bread cheese, inspired by the Finnish delicacy that just happens, by idiomatic coincidence, to pair wonderfully with garlic. It’s crafted for us by master cheesemakers in Wisconsin, who take blocks of rich, thick, cow’s milk cheese, cover them in garlic powder, then bake them to a beautifully golden-brown hue. 
 
 Known in its native Finland as juustolepä, Bread Cheese contains no wheat, or gluten, nor anything else of that nature, but rather gets its name from its hearty, remarkably bread-like consistency and squeaky, Halloumi-like texture. And much like Halloumi, Trader Joe’s Garlic Bread Cheese is best served nice and warm, after it’s had a chance to get just a little melty and gooey. Fun fact: in Finland, Bread Cheese is typically eaten in the morning, dunked in coffee. We find that the bold and savory notes of garlic in this Bread Cheese are better suited for a bit of Organic Marinara Sauce, ourselves.","['Food', 'Cheese', 'Wedges, Wheels, Loaves, Logs']",https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/garlic-bread-cheese-071622,$4.29,6 Oz,,Gluten Free,"['PASTEURIZED MILK', 'SALT', 'GARLIC POWDER', 'MICROBIAL ENZYME']",CONTAINS MILK.,"['Feeling Adventurous', 'Pair With Wine', 'The ""X"" Factor', 'Unexpected']",['1 oz(28g / about 1 inch cube)'],['90 ']

That product’s success prompted us to search the culinary seas for an organic counterpart. Once we found one—and once we realized it wouldn’t cost much more—we decided to completely replace the old with the new. So, say hello to Trader Joe’s Organic Shelled Hemp Seeds!   Like the previous version, these are Just the Hemp Hearts, meaning they’ve been hulled to remove the fibrous shell. Though removing the shell does mean less fiber than one might find in other so-called “super seeds,” such as flax or chia, it also means these Seeds make it easier for your body to digest and absorb the nutrients. This is very good news, since our Organic Shelled Hemp Seeds contain plant-based protein (10 grams per 3 Tbsp. serving), and also Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids.   Seeds sans shell also allows a texture that is soft and chewy. This, combined with their fresh, nutty flavor, makes for a pleasant profile that complements a plethora of foods, including yogurt, oatmeal, salads, smoothies, dips, and more!

And if that weren’t enough, it’s even more savory and satisfying — our best Lentil Vegetable Soup yet, if we do say so ourselves.   Made from a simple, yet elegant, recipe of organic potatoes, onions, carrots, spinach, green beans, and lentils, slowly simmered in a rich, organic tomato-based broth, this Soup has a comfy, homey flavor and a lovely mix of tender, toothsome textures. It’s as simple to prepare as pouring into a saucepan and heating until steamy, and takes especially well to toppings like grated Parmesan or crunchy croutons.

And, to our great surprise, Chocolate Hummus does, in fact, taste really good.   Made from a standard base of cooked chickpeas, tahini, expeller pressed canola oil, & sea salt, Trader Joe’s Chocolate Hummus is, texturally speaking, just like any other smooth & creamy hummus—it’s even made for us by a vendor that produces a few of our “regular” hummus varieties. Flavor-wise, however, Chocolate Hummus presents a whole new world. We’ve swapped the savory for the sweet—instead of garlic, roasted red peppers, eggplant, or any of the other typical hummus mix-ins, we’ve added in cane sugar, cocoa, & a bit of natural flavor in their place.

Mediterranean Hummus is super smooth and creamy, a bit more “whipped” than many of our other hummus choices. The texture of hummus tends to be different depending on where in the world it originates, so it makes sense for us to offer some of that variety in our stores. We’ve also taken the liberty of topping Trader Joe’s Mediterranean Hummus with crunchy pine nuts, and a bright blend of parsley, red bell pepper, and olive oil which creates a distinctive flavor and texture profile we think you’ll really enjoy.

But we like to think the main reason is that they’re just naturally delicious.   Take what you’ll find in every can of Trader Joe’s Organic Garbanzo Beans, for instance: small, tender, and toothsome, they have a light, nutty flavor that perfectly complements spices like cumin and coriander. They’re satisfyingly crunchy when roasted, delectably creamy when mashed, there’s a reason these legumes are so legendary. And as if that weren’t enough, they also have the added utility of creating aquafaba when packed in water (as ours are).

italian-lagorai-semi-soft-cheese-054875,Italian Lagorai Semi-Soft Cheese," Imagine finding an antique wooden spoon with some writing on the back of it. Upon closer examination, you find this flat, wide, spoon to have small drain holes. It’s a very old cream skimmer. Then, you realize that the message on the back is actually a recipe—step-by-step directions for making farmhouse cheese, exactly the way it was done by an anonymous dairy farmer who lived years ago in the Eastern Italian Alps.   If you were to follow that recipe (like we did!) you would end up with our Formaggio Lagorai (La-gor-EYE). This is a traditional cheese made for us in the Lagorai mountains of Trentino, Italy... from an actual recipe found on the back of a spoon. The milk comes from cows that feast on pristine Alpine grasses. Their fresh milk is shipped daily to skilled dairy artisans, who filter and chill it (to maintain it’s natural characteristics) and then process it—following the recipe, exactly as it appears on the back of that old skimmer.

protein-patties-065240,Protein Patties,"It may seem far outside the ordinary, implausible, even, but plant-based burgers have become one of the most popular food trends of the past few years, and there's no sign of slowing down. Folks are increasingly going for meatless burgers for all kinds of reasons, but we like to think that one reason in particular is primarily responsible: plant-based burgers have gotten really, really good recently. That's why we decided to bring in our very own Trader Joe's Protein Patties, a pair of pea protein-based, quarter-pound burger Patties that offer the flavor and texture of a traditional beef hamburger, but with none of the meat - or any other animal-based ingredients, for that matter.
 
 Throw these Protein Patties on the grill or in a hot skillet, and they'll sizzle and brown, just like a traditional burger. Serve them warm on a toasty bun and take a bite, and you'll experience their satisfyingly savory flavor and marvellously meaty texture, just like in a traditional burger. Why, thanks to the crafty inclusion of beets in the ingredient deck, they'll even stay soft and pink in the middle - just like a traditional burger. Unlike a traditional burger, though, Trader Joe's Protein Patties are totally vegan - but that doesn't stop them from supplying a whopping 18 grams of protein per patty.
 
 Implausible as they may seem, Trader Joe's Protein Patties are here, and our veggie burger game will never be the same.","['Food', 'Meat, Seafood & Plant-based', 'Plant-based Protein']",https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/protein-patties-065240,$4.49,8 Oz,,Kosher,[],,"['Dinner Hack', 'Yes!']",['1 patty(113g)'],['290 ']

Where many instant coffees are freeze dried, our 100% Colombian Instant Coffee is agglomerated, which literally means “formed into a round ball.” In this case, it specifically means that the beans are granulated using a steam-heat process, which makes the coffee incredibly soluble; a heaping teaspoon dissolves quickly and easily into a cup of hot water—no stubborn granules left behind.

Most refrigerated dressings are heat pasteurized for safety. That’s great for safety; not so great for maintaining the fresh flavors of otherwise raw foods.

The curds are bathed in a salty brine (think of it as “pickling” but with cheese!), then drained, gently pressed and dried to allow the saltiness to infuse throughout. This process creates a buttery tanginess and a slightly firm texture that crumbles with ease. Crumbly, briny Cheese made with organic milk? Be still our palates!   Although a handful of Crumbled Feta atop a crisp romaine salad is a wonderful thing, there’s an endless number of ways to enjoy its salty goodness outside of leafy greens.

Organic White Quinoa is a protein rich alternative to rice, couscous or pasta and is gluten free. This ancient grain has more than 5,000 years of history, and was so prized by the ancient Incas that it earned the designation “the mother grain.” Unlike most grains, Quinoa is a complete protein, meaning it contains all the essential amino acids in a balanced protein. It is often cited as one of the best protein sources in the vegetable kingdom.   Use Organic White Quinoa like you’d use rice. It’s that easy, and it cooks faster, too.

organic-roasted-seaweed-with-sea-salt-062405,Organic Roasted Seaweed with Sea Salt," Seaweed grows in the ocean—not in fields on land—so the idea of “organic” seaweed may seem a little strange. What, then, makes Trader Joe’s Organic Roasted Seaweed with Sea Salt “organic”?   Well, in farming conventional seaweed, farmers typically use food-grade acid to eliminate the presence of un- wanted species growing on the underwater crop. Instead of using these chemicals, however, the South Korean farmers who grow our Organic Seaweed use two natural methods to control pests. Seaweed is grown on ropes that are either attached to floating buoys, or to fixed poles in shallower tidal waters. When the buoys rotate, the seaweed is exposed to sunlight. Likewise, when the tide is low, the poles are “raised” out of the water, allowing sunlight to reach the seaweed. In both cases, it’s the exposure to sunlight that naturally controls the growth of unwanted species on the crop.   Once harvested, this seaweed is roasted, cut, lightly misted with organic sunflower oil, & sprinkled with sea salt (the oil makes the salt stick.) The result is a yummy snack that is perfectly salty and rich in umami. This snack is made even more perfect by our packaging—six, 0.17-ounce mini-packs, sold together in one, 1.05-ounce clear package. These little packs are small enough to stow anywhere—lunch boxes, desk drawers, backpacks, purses— but big enough to satisfy your savory snack cravings!

Our Italian supplier uses tomatoes as the foundation, with sunflower oil, Parmesan cheese, garlic, and some basil—though not as much basil as one would find in green pesto. Pine nuts, typical of Genoese pesto, are exchanged for cashews in our Pesto Rosso. Carrot purée pumps up the red-orange color, while also adding some subtle sweetness.

crunchy-chili-onion-062480,Crunchy Chili Onion," Similar to the jars of chili oil with crunchy garlic you can find on the table of many Chinese restaurants, the genius of Chili Onion Crunch is in its simplicity: with just a handful of simple ingredients, it creates a remarkably deep flavor profile that manages to accentuate the flavors of anything else it’s placed on. The crispy, crunchy, dried garlic and onion creates a delightfully bold, verging-on-umami base, while dried red bell pepper and chili flakes build onto that with complementary smoky, slightly sweet, subtly spicy notes. Most importantly, however, is the olive oil, which not only binds the other ingredients together, but becomes infused with a balanced blend of all the other flavors, combining them all into one superbly savory seasoning.   Which brings us to its application: we happily contend that Chili Onion Crunch truly does taste great on everything. Pizzas, burgers, burritos, hummus – anything and everything that you’d add hot sauce, steak sauce, or even just salt and pepper to, will benefit greatly from Chili Onion Crunch.

Just like the old version, it’s vegan and organic. Unlike the old version, it’s also gluten free and kosher (pareve). And it’s tastier, heartier, and more satisfying than any split pea soup we’ve ever carried before.   Taking inspiration from an iconic split pea recipe, this Soup is made with just a handful of organic ingredients, including onions, carrots, celery, garlic purée, and, of course, organic split peas (they’re the first listed ingredient, in fact!). Each spoonful is tremendously thick in texture and scrumptiously full-flavored — a perfect soup for making you feel warm and cozy from the inside out. For a quick dinner or lunch, it can be enjoyed with a sandwich on the side, or all on its own, topped with something crunchy and delicious like garlicky croutons or Crispy Jalapeño Pieces.

 Made with a blend of rice flour, tapioca starch, potato starch, and corn starch, Trader Joe’s Gluten Free Cinnamon Coffee Cake Muffins are everything you’d want in a muffin or a coffee cake—minus the gluten. They’re kind of like single-serve, muffin-shaped coffee cakes, with “cinnamon bits” (nuggets of crystallized cinnamon & sugar) throughout, with the added bonus of cinnamon, brown sugar, and coarse sugar on top. And thanks to the bit of buttermilk and spoonful or two of sour cream in the batter, the finished product is mega-moist and extra fluffy.

vegan-feta-cheese-alternative-071068,Vegan Feta Cheese Alternative," Our latest venture into the frontier of vegan cheese alternatives takes us all the way to Greece, where one of our steadfast suppliers has crafted a particularly delicious, plant-based version of Feta. Starting with an ingenious mix of coconut oil, potato starch, and even a bit of potato protein, they make this creamy, savory Feta Alternative in blocks, which they then store in brine, which gives it an extra touch of authenticity and helps develop that classically salty Feta flavor in one fell swoop. You could call it vegan verisimilitude at its finest. We call it Trader Joe’s Vegan Feta Cheese Alternative.   Just like its traditional, sheep’s milk-derived version, this Vegan Feta Alternative has a myriad of appetizing applications, from being crumbled over a salad, to presenting as part of a mezze platter with olives and antipasti, or even baking into a plant-based spanakopita. Speaking of baking, it makes a great vegan version of a particularly trendy appetizer recipe when roasted with cherry tomatoes and olive oil. Even just on its own, sliced and served on your favorite cracker or crostini, Trader Joe’s Vegan Feta Cheese Alternative is a triumph of plant-based cheese — and a must-have when making vegan versions of classic Mediterranean cuisine.

And much like those spindles of old, this helix-like structure has a highly practical purpose: the twists and turns of each tender piece of Fusilli are perfectly designed to hold onto all kinds of sauces. Which is just one of the reasons why Trader Joe’s Fusilli has been an all-star of our pasta shelves for more than 25 years.   Another reason? How about its impeccable texture? Once cooked for about ten minutes in salted, boiling water, our Fusilli remains firm, but yielding to the bite, giving any dish its added to a delectably toothsome quality. Or how about its versatility? As delicious as it is, simply tossed with Roasted Garlic Marinara or Cacio E Pepe Sauce, it’s equally excellent when added to hearty soups or used to create pasta salads. And, then, of course, there’s its price. Because you’ll only find imported Italian Fusilli of this quality for less than a dollar at Trader Joe’s. Here’s to another 25 years!

calrose-rice-070185,Calrose Rice," So much depends upon the length of a grain of rice. Though it may sound trivial, the textural difference just between long and medium grain rice is a whole other world, culinarily speaking. Whereas long-grained varietals like Jasmine and Basmati tend to have a drier, more individualized texture, like you’d find in a typical fried rice dish, medium-grained rice tends to be a little closer and stickier, like what you’d expect to find in risotto or paella. Trader Joe’s Calrose Rice is a classic example of the latter. Once cooked, it’s elegantly soft and fluffy, and holds onto flavors with ease — the perfect rice for poke or teriyaki bowls, and just the thing to round out our rice selection.   First developed in California in the late 1940s, Calrose Rice has since become one of the more popular rice varietals in the world, and by far the most widely grown varietal in California. After tasting it, it’s easy to see why: with its mild flavor and sticky texture, it takes on sauces and seasonings beautifully, without sacrificing any of its satisfying starchiness. Try it out with our classic Mandarin Orange Chicken and you’ll see exactly what we mean.

They also love it for the variety of vitamins and minerals it supplies. But not all people love the fibrous stems that are often present, even in pre- cut, packaged kale. Those woody stems stick out in an otherwise pleasantly crunchy green salad. They can also make your green smoothie significantly less than smooth.   For these reasons, we sought out a kale supplier who could bring us the best of kale, minus the unpleasant stems. And we found it –Trader Joe's Organic Shredded Kale it’s trimmed and coarsely chopped to eliminate any large stem pieces that may still remain. The result is an excellent eating experience—whether your kale is boiled in a soup, sautéed and served with pasta, blended in a smoothie, or eaten fresh in a green salad.

We’ll forgive you for guessing “an Oompa Loompa,” for while that’s an understandable attempt, the true answer is Trader Joe’s Cara Cara Navel Oranges.   Cara Cara Navel Oranges were first discovered in 1976 at the Hacienda Cara Cara in Venezuela (you knew that name had to come from somewhere, right?), making them a relatively recent entry into the fruit kingdom. From Venezuela, the fruit was brought to Florida, then to California, where it adapted perfectly to the climate and has thrived. Lucky us.   Cara Cara Navel Oranges look like a cross between a blood orange and a grapefruit. Their taste, however, is unique. Very sweet, with just a bit of spice. You may even be reminded of berries as you enjoy these orbs of deliciousness—we’re not alone in finding their flavor reminiscent of raspberries and strawberries.

Equally delicious when plopped into a dry martini or simply eaten as a quick snack, Trader Joe’s Spanish Manzanilla Olives with Pimentos are conveniently pre-pitted and stuffed with piquant pimento peppers, making them a top-knotch option for tapas, a go-to for cocktail garnishes, and a prime choice for charcuterie.   The secret lies in the complementary relationship between Pimento and Olive: here, the Manzanillas’ firm, yet tender-to-the-bite texture and briney flavor play perfectly off of the fruitier, more peppery notes of the Pimento.

In honor of these chiles’ special place in Southwestern cooking, we’re proudly introducing Trader Joe’s Green & Red Hatch Chile Flakes to our shelves, so that their spicy, singularly New Mexican flavor can be enjoyed at home in dishes of all kinds — no matter which state your home happens to be in.   Of course, these aren’t just any chiles: these are dried Hatch Chiles, from New Mexico’s renowned Hatch Valley. Widely praised for their unique, savory taste (some detect notes of onion or garlic in their flavor profile), these Green & Red Hatch Chiles are especially great for adding heat and depth to taco meat, enchilada sauces, chilis, or stews. And since each jar contains both Red and Green Flakes, you get the benefits of each: both the round, slightly sweeter flavor of the more ripened Red, and the sharper, more vegetal flavor of the younger Green.

Already a superbly sumptuous eating experience in its own right, the silky-soft, fresh mozzarella exterior and sweet, delicately creamy interior of Burrata acts as a perfect foil to the earthy notes of black truffle, creating a uniquely delicious interplay of taste and texture — and one that you can savor in every bite of Trader Joe’s Truffle Buratta.   Made for us by an expert cheesemaker in Wisconsin, this Truffle Burrata uses the contrasts of its constituent ingredients to great effect, with each opposing aspect accentuating the other. The fresh mozzarella’s soft chewiness heightens the richness of the cream inside, which in turn is enhanced by the umami notes of the black summer truffle mixed within. It makes an excellent appetizer or side dish, especially when served with pasta or pizza, and even tastes amazing when melted directly onto of a wood-fired pizza, itself.

tete-de-moine-rosettes-semisoft-cheese-072427,Tête de Moine Rosettes Semisoft Cheese," One of only twelve Swiss cheeses with an official Appellation d'Origine Protegèe (""protected designation of origin""), Tête de Moine is a cheese with an 800-year-old recipe. It’s crafted with part-skim cow’s milk, the fresh product of eight village creameries in the Swiss region of origin. Once made, the petite, cylindrical wheels of cheese are matured on spruce wood boards for at least two-and-a-half months. Now, here’s where it gets really interesting: Each wheel is centered on a steel post so it may rotate while a very sharp cutting tool is dragged along the surface of the cheese. The result is super-thin and long slices that naturally curl as they are cut, forming what resembles a delicate rose.   In addition to the intriguing look of these Rosettes, the increased surface area that comes in contact with the air changes the structure of the cheese, allowing its aromatic character to develop to the fullest. When popped in your mouth, the silky, ivory-colored, flower-shaped Cheese literally melts, creating a cheese-eating experience like no other!

Complex and full-bodied, with a lively acidic backbone and graceful notes of blackberry and plum, it delivers a delectably robust and fruit-forward profile, while still maintaining an approachable air of delicacy, thanks in large part to its velvety soft tannins. It makes an ideal introduction to Pinot Noir for any fine wine neophyte, as well a dependable year-end staple for longtime wine lovers. And just as an ideal Pinot Noir should be, our Carneros Grand Reserve is very versatile when it comes to food pairing. Enjoy some with appetizers, like Brie En Croûte or Fried Olive Bites. As far as mains go, we find it goes exceptionally well with duck, turkey, or pork, and can even stand up to red meat, like our Porcini Beef Loin Roast.

Another positive in the pedigree column? This beautiful Brut is produced using Méthode Champenoise techniques, providing a Champagne-level experience without the accompanying price tag.

They’re made by pressing waffles made from a dense, flavorful batter in a hot iron, then quickly slicing those waffles in half while they’re still hot, and sandwiching sweet, stretchy caramel in between each slice. The resulting cookie is a uniquely delicious experience, especially when enjoyed in the traditional Dutch way: place a Stroopwafel over a hot cup of coffee or tea, and let the steam gently soften the caramel inside to a perfect level of gooeyness.

Imagine a fragrant blend of mango and papaya flavors, with faint notes of apricot and cinnamon—and that’s the Fuyu!   Fuyu Persimmons make a great snack—most people enjoy them when they are firm, or just beginning to soften a bit. Their honeyed, tropical taste is a nice match for creamy, salty, nutty cheeses, like 1,000 Day Aged Gouda, and crunchy, bitter greens, like those featured in our Veggies & Greens Kit. And their striking orange hue makes them pop on a Thanksgiving tablescape, surrounded by an array of TJ’s Plants & Flowers, too.

We certainly did, so we looked into it. And as it turns out, in olden times, a sugar plum more generally referred to a kind of comfit, a candy confection made of chopped nuts and dried fruit — sometimes plum, but not always — covered in a sugary coating.   If this bursts your bubble, we’ve got something bubbly to make up for it: Trader Joe’s Sugar Plum Sparkling Beverage. No, this is a not a beverage made of melted candies. We took liberties with the sugar plum concept (as many others have done in modern times), and created a drink that is literally plum-based. Our supplier combines sparkling water with an equal proportion of blended plum juice and white grape juice concentrates, resulting in an ideal seasonal swig that is lower in sugar than 100% juice would be. It’s light, crisp, and joyfully fruity, and has a delightful, light-red hue that’s festive enough to complete any holiday vision, dancing or not.   Best served chilled (with a fresh cranberry garnish or a sprig of fresh mint), Trader Joe’s Sugar Plum Sparkling Beverage makes a charmingly cheery holiday drink for children and adults alike.

It’s a miniscule amount of prep (place it on a foil or parchment-lined baking sheet, and bake!) with a mightily palate-pleasing payoff; if you want to fancy things up further, let it defrost a bit and top with Red Pepper Spread & Toasted Pine Nuts, a dollop of tart Raspberry Preserves, or perhaps a sprinkle of Truffle Powder before baking.

Two olive varieties renowned for their flavor—green Castelvetrano olives from Italy and dark purple Kalamatas from Greece—are both pitted and finely chopped, then mixed and bound together, creating a kind of olive “dough,” if you will. Through the miracle of modern machinery, a velvety mixture of mascarpone, Roquefort, and cream cheeses is enveloped by this olive mix. Finally, these ‘cheese-stuffed olives’ are lightly battered, rolled in panko breadcrumbs, and fried to a crispness that retains its texture when you reheat these Bites for about 10 minutes in your own 400°F oven.

The sweet and delicate flavor of the scallops complements the smoky, savoriness of the bacon. And as the brown sugar caramelizes – oh, goodness – the result is delicious!   These tempting little morsels make excellent hors d’oeuvres, of course, but can also serve as a satisfying main course on a busy, holiday-season night – add a green salad and a loaf of crusty bread and the fan club will be duly impressed.

organic-taralli-and-friends-crackers-068840,Organic Taralli and Friends Crackers," We’re quite taken with Taralli. A traditional wintertime snack that dates all the way back to the 15th century, you could consider them to be the Southern Italian cousins to the mini-pretzel: they’re crunchy, bready, and splendidly savory, with a distinctive curlicue shape. Charming in their simplicity, they have a satisfying, breadstick-like texture, and mild, but habit-forming, flavor profile that’s accented by just a touch of olive oil and salt. And, like any true Italian treat, they make an excellent companion to wine — many Taralli enthusiasts like to dunk them directly in their vino before snacking, in fact. We’re so taken, in fact, that we took some organic Taralli, combined them with a number of similarly organic, crunchy, wine-friendly crackers, and placed them in our Organic Taralli and Friends assortment, just for the holidays.   Inside each bag, you’ll find the aforementioned ring-shaped Taralli, along with multigrain rustichelle, savory, onion-flavored tocchetti, and twisty, crumbly trecce. All four go great with wine, cheeses, antipasti, or anything else that can use a bit of textural pop, and all four will add some visual flare to any hors d’oeuvre spread, to boot.

ground-fermented-black-garlic-067160,Ground Fermented Black Garlic," There’s some serious science behind the fermentation process that leaves fermented garlic as black, soft, and surprisingly sweet as it is. When subjected to just the right level of heat and humidity, the allicin within fresh garlic — i.e., the chemical that gives garlic its uniquely pungent flavor and aroma — begins to break down into S-allylcysteine, a compound that turns the whitish garlic cloves black, softens them, and converts their distinctly garlicky flavor into something sweeter, richer, and more complex. Intrigued? We can’t blame you. Luckily, with Trader Joe’s Ground Fermented Black Garlic, it’s never been easier to add this extraordinary flavor to whatever dish strikes your fancy.   A long-standing staple of culinary traditions all across the Asian continent, Fermented Black Garlic makes an excellent addition to even the simplest of foods: soups, roasted potatoes, grilled meats, marinades, even a pot of simple stove top mac & cheese becomes an elevated eating experience with a few dashes of Ground Fermented Black Garlic.

They make for an excellent afternoon snack for youngsters and the young-at-heart, and their delicate, toasty sweetness make them ideal for crumbling over yogurt or ice cream, or even blitzing in a food processor for use in pie crusts or streusels. And that’s before we get to their real starring turn, as the foundation for a gooey, scrumptious s’more: put these together with a freshly toasted Marshmallows and a Milk Chocolate Truffle Bar, and we’re talking about some serious appreciation, there.","['Food', 'Snacks & Sweets', 'Candies & Cookies']",https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/graham-cracker-squares-071089,$3.49,14.1 Oz,,Kosher,[],CONTAINS WHEAT.,"['Date Night', 'Family Style', 'Midday Snacks']",['4 crackers(28g)'],['120 ']

It didn’t take long for us to team up and create a party-size bottle with some of their best bubbly. Incanto Prosecco, made from Glera grapes, is that wine—straw-yellow in your glass, and every sip crisp and aromatic.

In keeping with its innovative roots, Trader Joe’s Italian Roast Ground Espresso Coffee is a game-changer, too. Made with 100% Arabica beans that have been roasted to a warm, toasty medium dark, then ground to a super-fine espresso grade, this coffee’s full body, balanced acidity, and extended, earthy finish can be enjoyed as an espresso shot, a full-flavored pour-over, or a simply delicious cup of drip coffee, all with equal delight.
 
 Our supplier, a fourth generation coffee roaster from espresso’s original homeland of Italy, recommends a simple ratio of 1 ounce of cold water to 1 Tbsp of Ground Espresso when using an espresso machine, and a ratio of 6 ounces cold water to 2 Tbsp grounds when making drip coffee. Once brewed, this Coffee is rich and captivatingly aromatic, a natural companion to breakfast baked goods like flaky croissants or buttery scones. Looking for a way to change the game even further?

peri-peri-sauce-070096,Peri Peri Sauce,"Depending on your tolerance for heat, a good hot sauce can be one of the most versatile tools in your kitchen. Some hot sauces, however, go beyond versatility to reach indispensability. That’s certainly the case for Trader Joe’s Peri-Peri Sauce, a one-sauce-fits-all condiment that combines the welcoming heat of fermented chilies and dried chili flakes, the tangy tartness of lemon juice, and the savory splendor of garlic to create a uniquely enchanting flavor profile that genuinely goes with everything. It’s spicy, a little sour, even a little sweet, and has a smooth, creamy texture that keeps you coming back for more, bite after bite.
 
 Made for us by a supplier in South Africa, where peri-peri peppers are plentiful, this curiously complex Peri- Peri Sauce has an uncanny ability to not just match well with other foods, but to wake up and augment their flavors as well. From roasted chicken, to pork chops, to beer-battered fish, a nice drizzle of Peri-Peri can help bring out the inherent sweetness and depth of flavor to practically any protein. But that’s not all: it adds a new dimension to roasted veggies, tater tot nachos, and jackfruit tacos, it provides a delightful kick to fried rice, potato salad, or hummus, and makes an ideal dipping sauce for fried pickles, calamari, or tofu nuggets.","['Food', 'Dips, Sauces & Dressings', 'Salsa & Hot Sauce']",https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/peri-peri-sauce-070096,$3.49,6.76 Fl Oz,,Kosher,"['LEMON JUICE', 'WATER', 'FERMENTED CHILIES (CHILIES, SALT)', 'SUNFLOWER OIL', 'GARLIC', 'SALT', 'DRIED CHILI FLAKES', 'XANTHAN GUM.']",MAY CONTAIN TRACES OF SOY.,"['Feeling Adventurous', 'Mouth On Fire']",['1 tsp.(5mL)'],['10 ']

This suite of seasonal spices plays off of the natural (or should we say supernatural?) jamminess of the red blend to create a wine that’s so utterly easy-drinking, it’s almost frightening.
 
 Ghost Vine can be served at room temperature, or warmed and garnished with a cinnamon stick. It can be enjoyed all on its own, or paired up with a suitably rich dessert, appetizer, or cheese — in our experience, a spiced wine like this practically screams to be matched up with some Cave Aged Blue cheese.

 With the confidence of a customer who’d been around the banana-block, she shared with him that it would make her life much easier if we sold bananas individually, rather than in pre-packaged bunches. At her age, she explained, she wanted to take life one banana at a time. Well, we listened, and that’s why Trader Joe’s sells bananas one banana at a time. (You can hear him tell this story on the very first of episode of the Inside Trader Joe's Podcast.)

italian-capellini-047908,Italian Capellini,"In English, capellini translates to “little hairs,” and if you’ve ever cooked up Capellini pasta, you know its name is quite fitting. Once boiled, it looks like a fine, cascading blonde mane! The only pasta that even comes close to its super-fine texture is capelli d’angelo, or angel hair pasta, which measures just a fraction of a millimeter less in diameter.
 
 Trader Joe’s Italian Capellini is produced outside of Naples, in a region of Italy well known for pasta proliferation. It’s crafted for us by a family-owned company that’s been making pasta for more than 100 years. First, they mill durum wheat into golden semolina flour, add the purest water from the Madonie wildlife reserve, and begin the mixing. Then, once it reaches the right consistency, the dough is pushed through the proper pasta die, and the completed Capellini is left to dry. Our supplier’s attention to craft and commitment to technology results in consistent, quality Capellini every time.","['Food', 'For the Pantry', 'Pastas & Grains']",https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/italian-capellini-047908,$0.99,1 Lb,,Kosher,"['Product varies by region, please review packaging in-store for current details.']",,['Family Style'],[],[]

And let’s get one thing clear: Trader Joe’s Italian Linguine is a tasty product. It can be served with just a little olive oil, but becomes especially tasty when traditionally plated with a simple pesto to coat each elliptical noodle as you spin a bit onto your fork. Other common taste-elavating options include using tomato-based sauces or a light sauce with a seafood addition - think salmon, cod, or shrimp. In as little as 7 to 8 minutes of passively boiling pasta, you can have yourself a plate of Italian Linguine noodles, toothsomely al dente, of course, and you’ll be sending your tastebuds on a flavorful flight 6,000 miles across the Atlantic to our favorite boot shaped nation!","['Food', 'For the Pantry', 'Pastas & Grains']",https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/italian-linguine-047909,$0.99,1 Lb,,Kosher,"['Product varies by region, please review packaging in-store for current details.']",,['Family Style'],[],[]

Sure, Farfalle translates to “butterflies,” and they do in fact look like little butterflies as well, but when was the last time you heard anyone refer to them as “butterfly pasta”?
 
 Trader Joe’s Farfalle is made for us by one of the most renowned pasta makers in Italy, using a specific variety of wheat that’s grown only in Southern Italy. In fact, in accordance with Italian tradition, there are only two ingredients in the pasta – durum semolina flour and water. The texture of Farfalle makes it a winner in both hot and cold preparations. Serve it hot with our Arrabiata Sauce, or cold, in a pasta salad, with fresh, seasonal veggies, and your favorite dressing.","['Food', 'For the Pantry', 'Pastas & Grains']",https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/italian-farfalle-009292,$1.29,1 Lb,,Kosher,"['Product varies by region, please review packaging in-store for current details.']",,['Family Style'],[],[]

Penne Rigate","Penne (pronounced PEH-neh for the uninitiated) is one of the most famous Italian pasta shapes that’s beloved the whole world over.

Abiding by tradition, Trader Joe’s Italian Penne Rigate maintains this shape and is certainly a pasta that’s worth writing home about - in pen, that is.
 
 Each al dente forkful of our imported Italian Penne Rigate appears as simply just thick, tubular pasta with ridges. But its actually an ingenious design ideal for retaining sauces on all that surface area - inside and out! Because of all that surface area, our Italian Penne Rigate goes magnificently with chunky meat sauces, thick vegetable-based sauces, and rich cream-based sauces. Additionally, Penne often finds its way into many baked pasta and casserole dishes as the thick lil’ noodles make a wonderful foundation to load with meats, veggies, sauce, and heaps of cheeses, of course! Proudly made with only 100% durum wheat semolina, our Italian Penne Rigate can be ready to plate in as little as ten minutes in a boiling water bath!","['Food', 'For the Pantry', 'Pastas & Grains']",https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/italian---penne-rigate-009299,$0.99,1 Lb,,,"['Product varies by region, please review packaging in-store for current details.']",,['Family Style'],[],[]

And yet, simplicity is one of its greatest strengths — if you check the ingredient list on Trader Joe’s Chili Sesame Oil, for instance, you’ll see only sesame oil and dried red chilies. How can something so simple provide such stunning complexity? It’s best not to question it. Better instead to simply enjoy it on anything that could use a bit of savory spice, like pizzas, burgers, potstickers. spring rolls, and more.
 
 Made especially for us by a supplier in Thailand, Trader Joe’s Chili Sesame Oil lends foods a flavor boost that takes place in two phases: first, there’s the baseline of toasty, earthy sesame oil, which gives the brighter flavors of whatever you’re adding it to something to bounce off of. Critically, it also coats the tongue, which lets the heat of the red chilies take hold and begin to spread. The more you eat, the more intense the heat becomes, waking up the other flavors present and turning an everyday eating experience into something thrilling. Sounds exciting, no?

 As they marinate together in the brine, these Kalamatas don’t just take on some of the spice from their pepper partners, but some of their subtler flavors, too: there’s the fresh, vegetal notes of the jalapeño, and the brighter, tarter notes of the Peri Peri, each accentuating and enhancing the deeper Kalamata profile.

But since we’re not quite into “official” gingerbread season yet, we decided to make this a Haunted House Chocolate Cookie Kit instead.
 
 Given the fact the “original” edible, gingerbread abode was haunted by a wicked witch, we’d dare to say that calling it a Haunted House is superfluous. But with decorations like bats, skeletons, pumpkins and black cats, the name is quite descriptive.
 
 Absolutely enchanting, this prefab., ready-to-assemble Haunted House is made for us by dedicated gingerbread house kit innovators in Canada. The attention to character and detail is unparalleled, as are the ingredients used to make them.

organic-bourbon-barrel-aged-vermont-maple-syrup-063562,Organic Bourbon Barrel Aged Vermont Maple Syrup,"This is a story about how seemingly disparate industries reuse and recycle materials and help each other improve their products. It’s a delicious story. It begins with American Bourbon distillers, and the white oak barrels they use to age their whiskey. When those barrels have served their purpose in the distillery (they’re used only once for Bourbon), they could be destroyed or put out to barrel pasture. Instead, our Organic Bourbon Barrel Aged Vermont Maple Syrup supplier snatches up those barrels and gives them a second life, aging Organic Maple Syrup from Vermont, instead of spirits. The charred oak sugars that once colored and flavored Bourbon impart their character on the rich Maple Syrup, and a truly unique liquid amber is created.
 
 While this is mighty special Syrup, we think it’s appropriate to use anytime and anywhere you’d use ordinary maple syrup – on pancakes, waffles, or French toast; over ice cream; in all kinds of recipes. You might be wondering, does Trader Joe’s Organic Bourbon Barrel Aged Vermont Maple Syrup still taste like maple syrup? It does!

It’s made with pumpkin purée, heavy cream, some honey for sweetness, and spices including cinnamon and nutmeg. The not-so-secret ingredient (it’s on the label after all) that pulls all the flavors together is tahini. The savory nuttiness of sesame gives the soup a depth that none of us were expecting, and that left every last one of us wanting more.
 
 We’re bringing Pumpkin Bisque into our stores for a limited time, during Pumpkin Season.

kintamani-small-lot-coffee-070105,Kintamani Small Lot Coffee,"The latest entry into our Small Lot Coffee series takes us to the Kintamani region of Bali, where the rich, volcanic soils (courtesy of nearby Mt. Batur) and warm climate create an ideal environment for growing bold, flavorful coffee beans. Here, in the lush, humid highlands, farmers hand-pick coffee cherries and wet-process them using the traditional giling basah method, where hulls are removed before the beans are completely dried, resulting in a stronger body and relatively reduced acidity. It all makes for a deliciously unique (and uniquely delicious) cup of coffee that could only come from Kintamani. In other words, everything a Trader Joe’s Small Lot Coffee should be.
 
 With its medium dark roast and balanced profile of orange peel, dried fruit, and warm vanilla, Trader Joe’s Kintamani Small Lot Coffee is perfect for serving with sweet, fruit-forward pastries and hearty breakfast foods. Each sip starts with a spicy, almost peppery note, which is intercepted by the coffee’s balanced acidity, and eventually flows into a gentle, vanilla-tinged finish. It all makes for a smooth, yet bold, start to your morning, but be warned, if you want a chance to enjoy it, act soon.

It’s made with pasteurized sheep’s milk, animal rennet, salt, and proprietary cheese cultures. The inclusion of peppercorns adds even more distinction, and a mild kick.
 Canestrato Pepato’s pleasantly piquant profile with its peppery notes, occasionally crunchy texture, and underlying rich, nutty flavor, is delightful when enjoyed with a pale ale.

spatchcocked-lemon-rosemary-chicken-056660,Spatchcocked Lemon Rosemary Chicken,"“Dispatch the cock!” One might alternatively say, “Expedite the chicken!” The theory goes that some hungry Irishman came up with this poultry preparation method that involves the splitting and flattening of a chicken, thus accelerating the rate of cooking, since more of surface area is in touch with the grill or other cooking surface. In short, cooking time is shortened, and the done bird is moister (breasts don’t overcook while the rest of the bird finishes), with lots of nice, evenly crisp skin.
 
 While Spatchcocking isn’t necessarily brain surgery, it does take some extra work in the kitchen, which some feel negates the time you save actually cooking the bird. Trader Joe’s negates this negation by providing a fully Spatchcocked Chicken, ready to grill or roast. Not only is it already ‘butterflied’ for you, it is also pre-seasoned; soaked in a brine with orange and lime juices, and marinated in extra virgin olive oil, vinegar, garlic, rosemary, parsley, and lemon slices.
 
 Remove Trader Joe’s Spatchcocked Lemon Rosemary Chicken from its package (leave the lemon slices in tact and don’t rinse it), and put it on a pre-heated grill skin-side down until it’s well-browned and its internal temperature reaches 165ºF on a meat thermometer.

And that’s before we get to its boundless baking opportunities: the creamy center of a vegan danish, the swirl in a pan of vegan brownies, or the frosting of a vegan red velvet or carrot cake aren’t just possible, they’re now all as simple as grabbing a tub of Trader Joe’s Vegan Cream Cheese Alternative from your neighborhood Trader Joe’s cheese section.","['Food', 'Cheese', 'Cream and Creamy Cheeses']",https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/vegan-cream-cheese-alternative-070942,$2.99,8 Oz,,Dairy Free,[],,"['Brunch All Day', 'Rise & Shine']",['2 Tbsp.(28g)'],['90 ']

Not to insinuate that it was easy. Not at all. It took months and months of tasting and re-tasting by our panel. (Yes, it’s a messy job, but someone had to do it!) When the chocolate chip cookies finally reached the proper crunchy-chewy ratio (which changed, by the way, depending on how long they’d been frozen), we moved on to the ice cream; it had to be truly transcendent. After a few go-rounds, we landed on the ideal balance of cookie and ice cream. Then, of course, we had to make them even better, so we rolled the sides in mini, semi-sweet chocolate chips.

cold-brew-coffee-concentrate-050759,Cold Brew Coffee Concentrate,"When it comes to brewing, what’s the difference between hot and cold? Yes, temperature, of course, but also bite. Cold brewed coffee is never heated. As a result, the oils and acids that are released commonly with heat, don’t pass through to the brew. No longer masked by the compounds that give coffee its famous bitter bite, the nuanced lush, fruity flavors of the beans becomes strikingly more perceptible and, some would argue, more enjoyable. With more than 50% less acid than a hot brewed cup, cold brew is truly smooth.
 
 Cold brewing is hot. While we’re pro-DIY, the actual percolation and filtration can take somewhere between 12-24 hours. Don’t know about you, but our cup of coffee can’t always wait, so; we bottled it! Working with craft coffee roasters in Texas, we start with a half a pound, medium roast, 100% Arabica beans from the world’s finest growing regions. The beans are ground coarsely and specially filtered to create 32 ounces of delicious, naturally sweet, ready-to-pour Trader Joe’s Cold Brewed Coffee Concentrate. That’s equivalent to about 96 ounces of coffee beverages when reconstituted with water, milk, etc. If you like it strong and steamy, mix it with a bit of hot water for a smooth cup. Or pour it over some ice for a cold cold brew. If you want to keep the coffee as concentrated as possible, you can use it to make coffee ice cubes for your iced coffee. And since it’s ideal for adding coffee flavor without the acid bitterness, it’s even great for use in baking, marinating, making cocktails or served Affogato-style over ice cream.","['Beverages', 'Coffee & Tea']",https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/cold-brew-coffee-concentrate-050759,$8.99,32 Fl Oz,,Kosher,"['FILTERED WATER', 'COFFEE']",,"['Rise & Shine', 'Time-pressed']",[],[]

And then something entirely unexpected happens. The smooth creaminess of the Cheddar gives way to a tangy flavor and slightly crumbly texture, a subtle hint of salt crystallization is discovered, and it begins to taste like an aged Parmesan. Unexpected indeed!
 
 Our cheese makers, based in Wisconsin, have origins in Valdastico, in Italy’s mountainous, Northeastern Veneto region. In this cheese, they’ve combined the best qualities of hard Italian cheeses like Parmesan with the best qualities of finely crafted American Cheddar and created a semi-hard cheese that pairs well with lighter- bodied red wines (think Pinot Noir) or pale ales. Joined by crusty bread, a slice of your favorite salami, and Fig & Olive Crisps, this cheese is unexpectedly perfect.
 
 As with most cheeses, we suggest letting Unexpected Cheddar breathe at room temperature for about 30 minutes prior to serving. If you’re prepping a platter, unwrap the cheese and resist the temptation to cut right in. Your patience will be rewarded with cheese that really lives up to its flavor potential.

Inspired by a classically British ploughman’s lunch pairing (cheese & chutney), these blending artists mix caramelized onion marmalade into the Cheddar, giving it a balanced sweet-savory bite and pleasing onion aroma. It’s firm, creamy and adorned throughout with bits of onion. It’s memorable!   Trader Joe’s Cheddar Cheese with Caramelized Onions is excellent served simply—cut and accompanied by crackers or small slices of rustic bread.

 Sweet Baby Thompsons are essentially regular Thompsons that have grown on ungirdled grapevines. Girdling is the practice of carving out a thin ring of bark around the main vine trunk, effectively preventing water and nutrients from traveling back down the plant to the roots—while still allowing water to rise from the roots to the fruit, up through the center artery of the tree.
 
 Girdled vines cause grapes to retain more water, producing larger, less sweet fruit. But since Sweet Baby Thompsons grow as nature intended on uncut vines (probably why this variety is also called “Natural Thompson Grapes”), they don’t swell as much with excess water, thus remaining smaller—and also wonderfully sweet!","['Food', 'Fresh Fruits & Veggies', 'Fruits']",https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/sweet-baby-thompson-seedless-grapes-061959,$2.99,1 Each,,,[],,['Picnic'],[],[]

matcha-green-tea-powder-057159,Matcha Green Tea Powder," Tea is important in Japan. It's at the center of communal life, providing a key ritual (literally) around which friends can gather. Each fleeting meeting is viewed as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and thus, deeply cherished. The common Japanese idiom, Ichi-go, Ichi-e (meaning, ""one time, one meeting"") provides the perfect description of this treasured tea time.   This value for meaningful human interaction really resonates with us... So, we're doing our part to help facilitate more such meetings among friends. Toward that end, we think our new Matcha Green Tea is a great start. It's hard to find time to slow down and taste the tea in your busy routine, but these individual packets of real Matcha Green Tea provide an easy way to brew an authentic, quality cup-anytime, anywhere. Our vibrant emerald-green tea powder comes from tea leaves that are grown and ground for us in Japan. Brewed, it has a rich taste that presents a delicate hint of sweetness. Each 1.5 gram packet (there are seven in the box) is the perfect amount to mix with eight ounces of hot water for a steaming cup of Matcha... better make it two! Ichi-go, Ichi-e.

cheddar-gruyere-melange-cheese-095552,Cheddar & Gruyere Mèlange Cheese,"Some foods have a long history. Few, though, can be traced back to the last ice age. Trader Joe’s Cheddar & Gruyere Mèlange, however, is so deeply rooted in the land, that the only way to completely understand it is to go back just that far. What is now northwestern Wisconsin was once barren land covered with glaciers. As the glaciers melted, they left behind a countryside of rolling hills and pasturelands, pasturelands that now serve as the main diet of the cows that produce the milk used to craft Trader Joe’s Cheddar & Gruyere Mèlange. So, when you think about it, it all goes back to the glaciers. People talk about terroir in relation to wines: this brief history is testimony to the fact that it can be just as appropriate in describing certain cheeses. The history of Cheddar & Gruyere Mèlange at Trader Joe’s isn’t quite as ancient as the glaciers, but we have featured it in our cheese case for more than a decade. (If you’ve ever wept over the loss of a favorite product, you’ll know this is a lifetime in Trader Joe’s years!)

mexican-style-roasted-corn-059063,Mexican Style Roasted Corn,"In much of Mexico, as well as many parts of the American Southwest, street vendors sell well-seasoned corn on the cob that’s known as elote. It’s almost always on the cob, and nearly always on a stick. The seasonings vary, but generally include chili powder, cheese, lime or lemon, and a sour cream (crema) based sauce. If you haven’t encountered these street vendors in your travels, you’ve been missing out on something delicious. And even if you have had the opportunity to enjoy elote in its natural environment, you’re not always going to be near a street vendor, right? To satisfy your elote desires at those times, we’ve developed Trader Joe’s Mexican Style Roasted Corn with Cotija Cheese.
 
 For this at-home version of what’s often called street corn, we’ve opted to take the kernels off the cob. We’ve enrobed the corn in a creamy, smoky sauce that melts off as the corn heats – it seems magical, but it’s really just simple thermodynamics. It’s also spiked with lime juice and studded with cilantro, lending additional authenticity. A packet of Cotija cheese is included in each package of Corn – when the corn is heated through and ready to serve, sprinkle the crumbled cheese on top. It’s the ideal finishing touch to this crunchy, sweet, smoky, spicy dish. Present it as a side dish with a Mexican-inspired meal, or serve it in individual ramekins as an appetizer course.","['Food', 'From The Freezer', 'Entrées & Sides']",https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/mexican-style-roasted-corn-059063,$3.79,14 Oz,,,"['CORN', 'SAUCE (SOUR CREAM [CULTURED CREAM], WATER, MAYONNAISE [EXPELLER PRESSED CANOLA OIL, WHOLE EGGS, APPLE CIDER VINEGAR, WATER, EGG YOLKS, SEA SALT', 'MUSTARD {DISTILLED WHITE VINEGAR, WATER, MUSTARD SEEDS, SALT}, LEMON JUICE CONCENTRATE]', 'CILANTRO, MAPLE SYRUP, CHILI POWDER, SALT', 'DRIED GARLIC, CORNSTARCH, SPICES, CHIPOTLE PEPPERS, LIME JUICE CONCENTRATE)', 'COTIJA CHEESE (PASTEURIZED MILK, SALT, CHEESE CULTURES', 'MICROBIAL ENZYMES, TAPIOCA STARCH, POTATO STARCH', 'CELLULOSE POWDER, NATAMYCIN [MOLD INHIBITOR]).']","CONTAINS MILK , EGG.",['Dinner Hack'],['1 cup frozen(113g)'],['180 ']

Or you can simply buy your Fresh Squeezed Limeade at Trader Joe’s.
 Most store-bought limeades only approximate the results you’d get at home and typically include added flavors or even high fructose corn syrup. They’re also typically made from reconstituted lime juice concentrate. Trader Joe’s Fresh Squeezed Limeade, on the other hand, is the closest thing to homemade you’ll find. Our recipe includes only three ingredients: sugar, water, and fresh, not-from-concentrate lime juice (which accounts for around 20% of the recipe!) Our supplier—a third-generation, family-owned fresh juice producer—not only expertly grows, selects, and squeezes the citrus themselves; they also purposely don’t pasteurize the juice, which allows the pure, sweet-tart Limeade flavor to shine through.","['Beverages', 'Juices & More']",https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/fresh-squeezed-limeade-096713,$3.49,32 Fl Oz,,Kosher,"['FILTERED WATER', 'GRANULATED SUGAR', 'LIME JUICE', 'LEMON JUICE']",,"['Bibulous', 'Glass Half Full', 'Heat Wave']",['8 floz(240ml)'],['120 ']

marula-facial-oil-068654,Marula Facial Oil,"Sclerocarya birrea means “hard nut” in Ancient Greek. Scientifically, this name refers to the marula, which is a deciduous tree of medium stature, growing mainly in southern Africa. The marula tree bears a fleshy fruit with seeds (hard nuts) inside. Locally, people like to mix the fleshy fruit with water and allow it to ferment to create a traditional alcoholic beverage; but globally, the marula is known for the cosmetic oil derived from its seeds.
 
 Trader Joe’s Marula Facial Oil is produced from the first (virgin) cold-pressing of marula seeds, harvested only when the fruit has fallen to the ground. The oil is light-textured and not greasy. It’s especially good for hydrating skin. Marula Oil also offers antioxidants to promote a soft radiance—that glowing visage you’ve been hoping for!","['Everything Else', 'For the Face & Body']",https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/marula-facial-oil-068654,$6.99,0.85 Fl Oz,,,['SCLEROCARVA BIRREA (MARULA) SEED OIL'],"CAUTION: FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY.

There’s some science behind that difference: when coffee grounds are mixed with hot water, they tend to release the coffee’s tannins, the chemicals that give coffee its natural, bitter edge (they’re also what gives red wine its “dry” flavor). With cold water, however, the tannins typically stay in the grounds, leaving a smoother, easier-drinking beverage. The same principle applies to tea: the colder and longer the steeping time, the mellower and rounder-flavored the tea. Need proof?

As if this duo were not already dynamic enough, we decided to go all out Organic. Each and every ingredient in our Sriracha & Roasted Garlic BBQ Sauce was produced using methods that preserve the environment and avoid synthetic materials, such as pesticides and antibiotics. 
 
 This marvelous marriage tastes of Sriracha and... BBQ Sauce. It is garlicky, sweet, and spicy—all at once. The flavors here enhance burgers, meat kabobs, beef or pork ribs, even grilled seafood. These might seem like rather expected applications for a sauce such as this, but the innovation doesn’t need to stop with Trader Joe’s. First, procure your own bottle. Open it up. Love it.

But when you put them together inside a nutty, consummately crispy cracker, as we’ve done with our summer-seasonal Trader Joe’s Strawberry & Jalapeño Crisps, you’ve got something truly transcendent.
 
 Enjoying each Crisp is a journey in itself, starting with the delectable crunch of the initial bite. That’s followed shortly by the jammy sweetness of the dried strawberry, which in turn is tempered by the savory nature of the buttermilk cracker base and the sunflower seeds that can be found throughout. Just as you’re done processing that pleasant pairing, you're struck, moderately at first, by the heat of the dried jalapeño. As you continue to snack on these Crisps, preferably with a nice, creamy dip or a savory cheese like our Unexpected Cheddar, that heat continues to build into a crescendo that must be tasted to be believed.

 Avast, me hearties! If you’re looking for a superb summer spirit that plays well with others, then say “Ahoy!” to Trader Joe’s White Rum Of The Gods. Made of pure cane sugar and distilled in Barbados (aka the birthplace of rum), it’s a clear, 80-proof (40% ABV) liquor that offers a soft hint of allspice in the nose, and a light caramel-sweetness on the palate with a clean finish. This fairly neutral flavor profile makes it a marvelous mixing partner, whether you prefer a Daiquiri, Mojito, or of course, a Piña Colada.
 
 After it’s distilled in Barbados, this White Rum Of The Gods travels the high seas (and then the highways) in bulk via “flexi-tanks” to a bottling plant in Wisconsin. This reduces the cost of transportation, without sacrificing the quality and authenticity of what’s inside the bottle—which is why we’re able to offer 750mL bottles of Trader Joe’s White Rum of the Gods for a few doubloons…er, dollars lower per bottle than we’ve seen elsewhere.

This mix is a carefully calibrated blend of three gluten free flours – cassava, cauliflower, and fonio – combined with baking powder & salt, making it ready to use for so many cooking and baking endeavors. Our supplier, originally from Nigeria, is passionate about bringing the foods she grew up with in West Africa to the American palate. Here, she’s combined Cassava – also known as yuca – a starchy, root vegetable that behaves much like wheat flour in baking, with Fonio, a nutrient-dense grain related to millet, and native to West Africa. When milled into flour, it delivers a mild, subtly nutty flavor. Including cauliflower powder (flour) in the blend means lower overall carbs than comparable gluten free baking mixes. This multi-purpose baking mix is mild-tasting, and produces baked goods that are dense and delicious – not grainy or gritty like some other gluten free mixes.

Kentucky Best is aged four years in new, charred American oak barrels; the finished result is an 80 proof Whiskey (40% alcohol) that’s highlighted by notes of honey and butter, as well as hints of plums and raisins.

 This wouldn't be Mexican Style Corn & Quinoa Salad if it didn't contain a healthy amount of Mexican style corn. But we go beyond the corn here.

 Once fully cooked from your oven (simply place them directly on the oven rack, from frozen, at 400'F for about six minutes), these Baguettes can be enjoyed in any way you would if they came from a boulangerie on the banks of the Seine: cut them into hunks and enjoy with a bowl of soup, tear into pieces and dip into a flavorful olive oil, even split them horizontally for an elegantly elevated sandwich.","['Food', 'From The Freezer', 'Appetizers']",https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/mini-french-baguettes-062839,$4.49,9.5 Oz,,,[],CONTAINS WHEAT.,"['Dinner Hack', 'Effortless Entertaining', 'Rain or Shine', 'Welcoming']",['1 baguette(45g)'],['110 ']

If you haven’t yet been sold on the pleasures of beans, Trader Joe’s Giant Baked Beans in Tomato Sauce makes a mouthwatering case.
 
 Our Baked Beans in Tomato Sauce is modeled after the traditional Greek dish called gigandes plaki; although, we’ve adjusted the recipe a bit, as we do.

This simple, yet delectable, mixture is baked to a rich consistency and finally, canned for you.

This ready-to-eat dish with its smooth, aromatic sauce; cubes of peeled tomatoes; and tender, melt-in-your-mouth beans does not disappoint—even enjoyed at room temperature, straight out of the can.

organic-french-baguette-053835,Organic French Baguette,"Following World War I, French workers rebelled against the upper crust for low wages and poor working conditions. By the early 1920s, the workers’ strikes had won important reforms, including strict limitations on long and grueling work hours.
 
 Under the new laws, French bakeries were forbidden to operate between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. Un- fortunately, well-rested bakers also meant that traditional French boules (round loaves) would not have enough time to bake before breakfast. Some historians suspect that this turn of events gave rise to the popularity of the baguette—a long, thin loaf with a shorter baking time—a shoo-in for the new breakfast-bread favorite among the French.
 
 Today, baguettes are a favorite nearly everywhere, all the time. At Trader Joe’s, our conventional baguette has always been the best-selling item in our artisan sections. Now, we have the opportunity to offer a version made with organic, unbleached flour at a highly competitive price. Each 11.5-ounce Organic French Baguette is an amazing $1.99.

 Winemakers Notes: Montepulciano, the grape, produces wines with even, active aromas, pronounced tannins and low acidity. It is the second most widely grown native grape in Italy, and one of its most popular as well – Montepulciano d’Abruzzo, from Italy’s Abruzzo region, is considered one of Italy’s top wine exports. The stems are separated from the grapes, which are softly pressed in cylinders under pressure gently breaking their skins and releasing the juice. The juice is left to macerate on the skins for about a week in rotating temperature controlled stainless steel vinifiers at a temperature of about 28-32°C (82-86°F).

 We thought a summer pasta sounded sensational and wanted our Girasloli to capture the radiance and warmth of its namesake. We turned to our revered Italian pasta makers for a recipe. Committed to preserving regional culinary traditions, they presented us with a fine Ricotta & Lemon Zest Pasta in the style of Sicily, using real Sicilian lemons.
 
 It starts with classic, fresh, Italian pasta, made with only three ingredients: soft wheat flour, durum wheat semolina and egg. Tender and rich, the pasta glows golden, courtesy of the egg. Rolled thin and custom cut to resemble a sunflower, it is then filled with fresh ricotta, naturally creamy and slightly sweet, that is mixed with lemon zest and balanced with butter, bread crumbs and salt. The bite captures a sunny, summer day in Sicily.
 
 While all of the elements are essential, the lemons paint the picture. Grown in the volcanic soil around Mount Etna, the authentic Sicilian lemons have a bright acidity and distinct sweetness. Their zest gives a clean taste to the ricotta and bright character to the Girasoli.","['Food', 'Fresh Prepared Foods', 'Entrées & Center of Plate']",https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/ricotta-lemon-zest-ravioli-053425,$3.99,8.8 Oz,,,"['FILLING (RICOTTA CHEESE [WHEY, SALT, CITRIC ACID]', 'BUTTER', 'BREADCRUMBS', '[WHEAT FLOUR, YEAST, SALT]', 'LACTOSE, LEMON ZEST, SALT', 'LEMON EXTRACT)', 'NOODLE (WHEAT FLOUR, EGGS', 'DURUM WHEAT SEMOLINA).']","CONTAINS MILK, EGG , WHEAT.","['Dinner Hack', 'Feeling Fancy']",['1 cup(83g)'],['240 ']
cultured-salted-butter-053720,Cultured Salted Butter," What makes really great butter? A little culture helps. We’re not talking about a night at the opera, but about the cherished micro-organisms, also found in yogurt and crème fraîche, which unleash depth and a pleasant tang in cream. Beyond the enviable culture-elicited flavor, butter is better when churned and churned and churned and... Lengthier churning lowers the moisture content, increasing the butterfat, and resulting in luxuriously creamy texture. And because one good churn deserves another, we’re bringing Trader Joe’s Cultured Salted Butter back to our dairy shelves, after a brief (and what some might call heartbreaking) hiatus.   Trader Joe’s Cultured Salted Butter is lightly salted, subtly tangy, enviably creamy, and it’s made for us in French dairy country, Brittany. You can use it in any culinary application that calls for butter; this Butter shines served simply on its own and in baking recipes. Slather it atop a piece of toasted, thick bread, like our French Baguette, and take a bite—it’s an ethereal experience. It’s also wonderful enjoyed melted as a dip for mild, peppery Organic Radishes of Many Colors. And when it comes to baking, quite frankly, there is no better Butter for homemade cakes, cookies, pies, and especially ambitious endeavors like croissants.

cauliflower-pizza-crusts-070961,Cauliflower Pizza Crusts,"As the years go on, we find ourselves returning to the same burning question, over and over: Truly, is there anything that cauliflower can't do? From salty snacks to ""rice,"" to dense, doughy pastas, this brilliant brassica boldly goes into territories normally dominated by carbs and bread, where veggies normally fear to tread. 
 
 Trader Joe's Cauliflower Pizza Crusts are another way to prove this theorem. Like our Cauliflower Thins, our Cauliflower Pizza Crusts are made of similar ingredients (by the same supplier, in fact). They use shredded cauliflower, whole eggs, and grated Parmesan to create a cohesive ""dough"" that holds together to form a flatbread-like round. Unlike the Thins, however, these Pizza Crusts are twice as large—8 inches vs. 4 inches—and lightly seasoned with garlic and herbs, including basil and oregano.
 
 Based on the name, you could correctly infer that these are excellent topped with some kind of sauce, cheese, and other toppings and baked in the oven for a gluten free pizza experience.

This approach not only prevents by-catch and perpetuates a more sustainable method of harvest, but ensures that only the highest-quality Scallops are selected, and ultimately, reach your plate.
 
 It’s a difference that you can taste immediately: these Peruvian Bay Scallops have a mild, elegantly buttery flavor and, when cooked to the right doneness, have a firm, springy texture that plays particularly well against pastas and citrusy sauces. Smaller in size than a standard sea scallop, Bay Scallops take only a few minutes to cook and are a natural fit for including in stews, topping salads, or even giving a light dredging in flour and sautéing until just crispy.

 Jerk chicken originated in Jamaica, and this rendition is seasoned for us with a variety of spices, including black pepper and chili, as well as sweet fruits like oranges and peaches. The chicken is threaded through wooden skewers and fully cooked, then frozen so you can have them on-hand when you want something that tastes great and time is of the essence. It’s robustly seasoned without being super spicy, so it makes a great center-of-the-plate entrée for the whole family. You could also remove the chicken from the skewers and serve on a salad, using the tart, tangy chutney as a dressing.

key-lime-pie-053250,Key Lime Pie," Sometimes tracking down the real story about a food’s history can be tricky, simply because, like all history, the information available to us is only as reliable as the folks who managed to write it down in the first place. And so it goes for Key Lime Pie, a treasure of the Florida Keys. We know for certain it originated in Key West in the 1850’s, and we know the key to the magic was (and is) canned sweetened condensed milk, which allowed cooks without easy access to refrigeration to quickly and easily make treats like ice cream or custard. Beyond that, the history gets murky, and really depends on whose story you choose to believe.   We do believe that all roads lead to the freezer case at Trader Joe’s. As tradition dictates, Trader Joe’s Key Lime Pie is made with sweetened condensed milk and true Key lime juice. Unlike other lime juices, Key lime juice is pale yellow in color. Some pies bearing the Key Lime name are bright green – we can assure you that this is not a natural occurrence, but rather the result of the inclusion of artificial color. The filling of our Key Lime Pie is pale yellow, just as it should be. It’s nestled in a classic graham cracker crust and arrives in a naked state, awaiting your meringue or whipped cream topping – while there is serious debate over which of these two adhere most closely to custom, you are free to choose your favorite.

 Within 24 hours of picking, they get to pickling in a garlicky brine with spices that include mustard and coriander seeds, allspice, black pepper, and bay leaves. But the real kicker is the hot Pfefferoni Peppers included in the jar.

coconut-cold-brew-coffee-concentrate-060338,Coconut Cold Brew Coffee Concentrate," When it comes to brewing, what’s the difference between hot and cold? Yes, temperature, of course, but also bite. Cold brewed coffee is never heated. As a result, the oils and acids that are released commonly with heat don’t pass through to the brew. No longer masked by the compounds that give coffee its famous bitter bite, the nuanced lush, fruity flavors of the beans becomes strikingly more perceptible. With more than 50% less acid than a hot brewed cup, cold brew is truly smooth.   While we’re pro-DIY, the actual percolation and filtration required for a proper cold brew can take some- where between 12-24 hours. Don’t know about you, but our cup of coffee can’t always wait, so we bottled it! Working with craft coffee roasters in California, we start with the same medium roast, 100% Arabica bean base as our original Cold Brew Coffee Concentrate. The beans are ground coarsely and specially filtered, then something special happens—natural coconut flavors are added to create a bold, smooth tasting, tropically-inspired brew—namely, Trader Joe’s Coconut Cold Brew Coffee Concentrate.   Mix one part Coconut Cold Brew Concentrate with two parts water or milk, and pour over ice for a lush, tropical hot weather treat. If you want to keep the coffee as concentrated as possible, you can use it to make coconut coffee ice cubes for your iced coffee. And since it’s ideal for adding coffee flavor without the acid bit- terness, it’s great for use in baking, marinating, making cocktails or served Affogato-style over ice cream.

The cattle are 100% grass fed, grazing on wide-open pastures – their diet of natural grasses and vegetation contributes to full-flavored, well-marbled beef that’s rich in Omega-3 fatty acids. Raising cattle organically, on grass, is a significantly more expensive endeavor than raising them via conventional methods. (If you’ve ever wondered why organic, grass-fed meat is more costly than conventional beef, this is why – it requires more space, more time, and more labor.) At Trader Joe’s, we work diligently to ensure that though the price may be higher, it still represents excellent value.
 
 85/15 is a reference to the ratio of lean-to-fat, meaning that this Organic Ground Beef is 85% lean and 15% fat. While sometimes leaner cuts make sense, this is our favorite ratio for burgers – you get richly-flavored, juicy burgers, every time.

The innovation? We’ve added pickles – Persian Cucumbers, to be exact. We’ve sliced them into thin rounds, lending extra texture to the kraut and providing just a little yummy pickle flavor. The tradition? This is Sauerkraut like your great grandma used to make. That means all-natural fermentation. No vinegar added. No lab cultures to kick-start the process. No cooking or pasteurization. It’s just raw cabbage and cucumbers with some sea salt and garlic. The salt draws water from the fruit and veggies (cucumbers = fruit; cabbage = veg) creating brine in which ‘good’ bacteria convert carbs into lactic acid, a natural preservative that inhibits ‘bad’ bacteria growth. 
 
 That lactic acid is also behind the tart and tangy flavor (more subtle than vinegary versions) and the extra crispy crunch of our cabbage-cuke blend. Top your Organic Beef Hot Dogs.

But, of course, as intrepid adventurers on the culinary seas (when not performing our bacon deliciosity expert roles, that is), we felt it was our duty to bridge that gap. That's why we've developed Trader Joe's No Sugar Dry Rubbed Uncured Bacon, because cutting back on sugar and salt shouldn't mean you miss out on bacon's savory splendor.
 
 Our supplier starts with pork that was raised crate free, completely vegetarian fed, and strictly without the use of antibiotics or hormones, then covers it in a dry rub composed of sea salt and spices like fenugreek, white pepper, and allspice-and, notably, no sugar. Once the dry rub has had time to set in, the bacon is then slow smoked over a blend of smoldering natural hardwood for seven to eight hours.
 
 The result is a superbly spiced, smoky bacon that crisps and crackles in your skillet just as bacon should, but without any of the sugar, and about 37% less sodium than the USDA standard. For those trying to cut their carbs while still enjoying a hearty breakfast, this one's for you-each strip of our No Sugar Dry Rubbed Uncured Bacon boasts an average zero grams of carbohydrates, and four grams of protein.

Next, the Bamba is cut into peanut-sized nuggets and air-baked for 20 seconds in a drying chamber, which gives it an even crispier texture.
 
 Finally, the Bamba is moved into large, rotating drums, where they are coated with hot, liquid peanut butter (made from peanut paste, palm oil, and salt). The resulting snack is crunchy, airy, peanutty and highly craveable-kind of like a cheese puff without the cheese.

That filling is folded into layers of delicate fillo dough then battered before it’s finally fried to a perfectly crisp bite.

mediterranean-style-orzo-pasta-salad-061302,Mediterranean Style Orzo Pasta Salad,"As traders on the culinary seas, we often find our inspiration for new products while traveling and exploring international cuisines. The Mediterranean region, with its bright blue waters, white-washed buildings, and idyllic weather, is a place bursting with wonderful food, and one that frequently inspires our innovation. Ironically, the idea for Trader Joe’s Mediterranean Style Orzo Pasta Salad did not come from such a voyage, but from a family recipe right under our noses... 
 
 What started out as “Carmen’s Famous Orzo Salad,” a side served at family gatherings and potlucks, eventually found its way to our tasting panel. The verdict was the same as every other time it had been tried: WOW. Our Mediterranean Style Orzo Pasta Salad, like Carmen’s, starts with a pasta salad made up of orzo, crumbled feta cheese, diced red onion, Kalamata olives, and sun dried tomatoes. It’s then tossed in a golden balsamic dressing and basil pesto and topped with shredded spinach—yes, a pasta salad that actually has some “salad”! The spinach-on-top layering ensures fresh leaves when it comes time to enjoy. Its savory and salty flavors perfectly evoke its regional namesake—it’ll be almost as if you traveled there! 
 
 Such a delicious Orzo Pasta Salad has so many moments to shine. Bring a few containers to that last-minute BBQ your neighbor is throwing, or enjoy it with grilled fish for a tasty lunch. Even better, turn it into the perfect Mediterranean summertime feast by adding Grilled Lemon Pepper Chicken and serving with Dolmas, Mediterranean Hummus, and pita bread.

After experiencing namkeen and specifically chakri for ourselves in India, we decided to engage our top supplier of Indian meals to create a special version just for Trader Joe's.
 
 In our Spicy Chakri Mix, the chickpea and rice flours are made into a traditional dough and similarly forced through a mold to make a spiny design. But, instead of spiraling this dough into discs, ours is cut into pieces then fried. The result is little sticks with that same crazy crunch as the spiraled version. We've added some textural interest and flavor contrast by adding peanuts and some fried curry leaves. The Mix is finally tossed in a moderately hot seasoning that includes red chili & jalapeño powders; fennel, coriander, mustard, & ajowan seeds; cumin, turmeric, and salt. Trader Joe's Spicy Chakri Mix is ideally paired with a hoppy IPA or crisp lager, and its savory flavor also goes very well with cubes of a mild, creamy cheese (we recommend Trader Joe's Double Cream Gouda).

To accomplish this, we reached out to one of our suppliers who makes sauce for a famous NYC Italian restaurant. They knew just how to proceed, beginning with 100% imported Italian tomatoes that have a sweeter profile, ensuring a less acidic, better tasting sauce. To make it meatier, they brilliantly… added more beef! In fact, this new sauce contains 9% beef, compared to the 6% in our previous Bolognese (6% is the industry standard).

According to local legend, this sensational starter was created when a chef accidentally plopped a fresh ravioli into the deep fryer instead of a pot of boiling water. While several restaurants in St. Louis's The Hill neighborhood claim to be the original site of this happy accident, there's one thing that's unambiguously clear: toasted ravioli are an appetizer to be reckoned with. That's why we're introducing Trader Joe's Breaded Fried Ravioli, a quick, convenient way to bring this regional treasure into your home with just a few minutes in the oven, skillet, or air fryer. 
 
 Each Breaded Fried Ravioli starts as a stately square of semolina pasta, filled with a mouth-watering mix of five kinds of cheese: creamy ricotta, mild Monterey Jack, rich mozzarella, savory Asiago, and piquant Parmesan. These Ravioli are then battered and deep fried to perfection, then flash frozen for you to finish the job at home. Once prepared (we find an air fryer to be particularly suited for the job), they're everything a cheesy appetizer should be: warm, gooey, and phenomenally cheesy, with a crispy, savory exterior—a little like a breaded mozzarella stick, taken to the next level.","['Food', 'From The Freezer', 'Appetizers']",https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/breaded-fried-ravioli-066183,$3.99,16 Oz,,,[],"CONTAINS MILK, EGG, WHEAT.","['Pair With Wine', 'Yes!', 'In Lieu of Pizza']",['4 ravioli(85g)'],['240 ']

We currently offer some fantastic honeys in our grocery aisle, but we haven't offered a creamed honey on our shelves in quite some time. So, when our Buyer stumbled upon an opportunity to do so, she pounced—or stung, as it were...Trader Joe's Creamed Multi-Floral New Zealand Honey comes from bees pollinating a variety of different flowering trees, shrubs, plants, and other nectar sources. As a result, its flavor profile is a little bit floral, a little bit herbal, and a little bit earthy—kind of like Manuka honey, but less medicinal-tasting. About 80% of New Zealand's trees and plants are endemic to New Zealand, so when we say you won't find honey like this anywhere else, we mean it!
 
 The real buzz about this honey, though, is that it's ""Creamed."" Does this mean we're adding milk products to it? Absolutely not!

Our supplier then takes this milk, adds a bit of salt (and, notably, nothing else), then uses traditional churning methods to create a profoundly creamy and delicious butter.

 Great for bringing along on road trips, keeping on hand at work, or simply enjoying at home, our Chile Spiced Pineapple is great for practically any snacking occasion.

vegan-bolognese-style-pasta-sauce-070839,Vegan Bolognese Style Pasta Sauce,"Though we might think of it as a rather timeless classic, bolognese pasta sauce is a relatively recent invention. First described in print in the late 1800s, ragù alla bolognese started as a descendent of French ragoût, a hearty, meat-based stew. Since then, there’s never really been one definitive recipe for a bolognese sauce — many iterations don’t even include tomatoes — other than a commonality of braised beef, veal, or pork as the center of the dish. In other words, out of reach for non-carnivores. Until today, that is: Trader Joe’s Vegan Bolognese Style Pasta Sauce evokes all the savory splendor of a perfectly seasoned bolognese, but does so with tender crumbles made of pea protein, resulting in a sauce with as much protein as its meat-based cousins.
 
 Made with tomatoes imported from Italy, our Vegan Bolognese is rich and satisfying to vegans and non- vegans alike with lightly herbaceous and peppery notes. Like our other jarred pasta sauces, preparation is as simple as warming on the stovetop until heated through, then mixing with freshly cooked and drained pasta. While spaghetti is a popular pairing choice outside of Italy, within Bologna itself, it's more often made with flatter, broader noodles like pappardelle, or tube shapes like macaroni or rigatoni, both of which complement its thicker, meatier texture.","['Food', 'Dips, Sauces & Dressings', 'BBQ, Pasta, Simmer']",https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/vegan-bolognese-style-pasta-sauce-070839,$3.49,16 Oz,,Vegan,[],CONTAINS  COCONUT.,"['Make It Meatless', 'Dinner Hack', 'Pair With Wine']",['1/2 cup(126g)'],['110 ']

 Unlike our previous, two-cheese incarnation, Trader Joe's Gluten Free Mac & Cheese is now made with the exact same four-cheese blend you'll find in our beloved Diner Mac-Cheddar, Swiss, Havarti, & Gouda, all made with milk from cows not treated with rBST. We also add milk & a house-made, gluten free béchamel to this four-cheese blend, which makes for a comforting creation that's extra thick & creamy.
 
 And lest we miss the mac for the cheese (as they say), we've taken equally great care in selecting the perfect pasta: a corkscrew-shaped Rotini made with a blend of corn, rice, lentil, & quinoa flours. The end result?

 They then take dried, smoked jalapeños and marinate them in a seasoned sauce of garlic and tomato-this is what puts the ""chipotle"" in Chipotle Vegetable Quesadilla. Savory onions, black beans and sweet corn are folded into the smoky, spiced sauce, and the mixture is then layered into the cheesy tortilla, which is then pressed to deliciousness-without a handful of broccoli or veggie patty in sight!
 
 These Quesadillas cook up beautifully in the microwave; if you go the stove or oven prep route, you'll end up with crispy tortilla edges that provide a pleasant counterpoint to the smoky cheesiness within.

 The clean, versatile flavor of Part Skim Ricotta Cheese leaves it open to all sorts of culinary interpretation. Enjoy it with a few cracks of salt & pepper, olive oil and chopped fresh herbs.

And, of course, each bite only furthers that spirit of unity, with the milk chocolate laying a smooth, creamy foundation, upon which the dark chocolate builds striking cocoa flavor which intermingles superbly with the sugary crunch of flawlessly dispersed granules of butterscotch. Truly, teamwork makes the dream work.
 
 While there's never a bad time or situation to enjoy a candy bar of this caliber, Trader Joe's Milk & Dark Chocolate Butterscotch Bits Bar's shareability and easy portioning make it an excellent choice for movie screenings, binge watch parties, or as a companion for long road trips and air travel.

 Trader Joe's Cauliflower Gnocchi (NYOK-kee) is made for us in Italy, and it's quite like those traditional Italian dumplings made of mashed potato, flour, and egg-hence, the Gnocchi designation. This version, however, is made with about 75% cauliflower, as well as cassava flour, potato starch, extra virgin olive oil, and sea salt. No wheat, sugar, dairy, or eggs are included here, and that translates to fewer carbs, with significantly less fat & calories than potato-based varieties.
 
 Our Italian supplier, who specializes in regular gnocchi, uses the cauliflower they've grown in their own fields to create soft-textured bites that are easy to prepare. Sauté and crisp-up in a stovetop pan-our favorite prep method that requires no thawing and results in crisp, never-overcooked Gnocchi.
 
 You can alternatively boil or microwave them for a more tender presentation. And like other gnocchi you've known, these are tasty tossed in butter, fresh sage, and TJ's Shaved Parmesan Reggiano. Or, if you prefer, Rustico Pomodoro Pasta Sauce and fresh basil. Any way is a good way to dress up our Cauliflower Gnocchi.

We went after tradition: chicken sausage flavored with sage and thyme, scrambled eggs, potatoes, sautéed onions, and white cheddar cheese live inside a chewy flour tortilla. The proportions are just right, so you'll get a little bit of everything in each bite. And, though it is a Breakfast Burrito, you don't have to restrict the time of day in which you enjoy it-it's always delicious.
 
 Maybe the best part about this Breakfast Burrito (after the Burrito itself, of course) is the endless condiment possibilities that lay before you. Do you like Organic Ketchup to accompany your breakfast? If you're from the southwest, you're probably reaching for the Salsa Autentica the second you hear ""breakfast."" Or maybe you like a spicier version, a lá Ghost Pepper Habanero Salsa.

We can thank Josephine Cochrane for making this chore a little less nettlesome: she invented the first commercially viable dishwasher in 1886. Yes, well over 100 years ago! Dishwashers are just as useful as ever, but are only as successful as the cleaning agents you use in them. Trader Joe's Dishwasher Detergent Gel is ready and up to the toughest dish washing tasks.
 
 Our Dishwasher Detergent Gel is made with a premium plant-based formula that uses a powerful enzyme system to make short work of whatever's waiting in your dishwasher. The non-toxic formula has a pleasant lemon scent from essential oils and botanical extracts (with no harsh fumes), and it contains no phosphates or chlorine.
 
 As a USDA-certified biobased product, our Dishwasher Gel is composed of biological products and renewable materials. Whereas most dishwasher detergents are mainly petroleum based, this Detergent is made with 65% biobased products.
 
 To get those dishes squeaky-clean, simply load dishwasher-safe items in your dishwasher, fill the dispenser cup 1/2 to 2/3 full and pour into machine. (Pro-tip: Silver, aluminum, and stainless steel should be washed in separate loads to avoid discoloration.) Voila!

It occurred to us that grinding some of our favorites together could yield delicious results. And so, we bring to you Trader Joe's Mixed Nut Butter, a nourishingly nutty blend of some of our favorite nuts.
 
 In the jar is a one-of-a-kind mix of almonds, cashews, walnuts, Brazil nuts, hazelnuts, and pecans, with just a bit of sea salt to round out the flavors. The nuts are dry roasted, then ground together into creamy bliss. Spread on sandwiches, celery sticks, or used in a grilled nut butter & banana sandwich, you'll love the rich, nutty nature of this Butter.

There are no soy ingredients in this product, and at 200mg of sodium per tablespoon (vs. 920mg in the leading soy sauce brand), this gluten-free, kosher (pareve) Sauce is a great option for those looking to reduce their sodium intake.   The savory notes of Organic Coconut Aminos Seasoning Sauce offer mouthwatering depth of flavor to marinades, on its own or paired with chopped garlic and fresh herbs. You can also use the Sauce as a seasoning springboard in a freestyled fried rice, or to add complexity to sautéed veggies and soups.

Our variant includes these delicious, organic ingredients: kidney beans, cannellini beans, vegetables (carrots, tomatoes, peas, and kale), orzo pasta, and copious amounts of herbs and spices. One bite and you'll be saying ""hooray for Minestrone!""
 
 Since minestra, the root of Minestrone, means ""to serve"" in Italian, it's only fitting that this soup be served-and served well!

Recipes that were once dependent on carbs have been freed by this bold and brassy little brassica. Take, for example, our Trader Joe's Riced Cauliflower Bowl, a classic veggie treat made even veggie-er by simply going against the grain.
 
 Inspired by the fare from some of our favorite vegan restaurants, our Riced Cauliflower Bowl is all about simple ingredients, big flavors, and a variety of fascinating textures. We start with a bed of riced cauliflower, topped with chopped sweet potatoes, red onions, & tofu. Next, we add chickpeas, which have been cooked and marinated in olive oil, then seasoned with chili powder, garlic powder, oregano, salt, & cumin. And for the final, finishing touch, we add a little sambal oelek red chili paste, a bit of tamari soy sauce, and a cool, creamy tahini sauce to tie all the flavors together. The result is a journey through a plethora of tastes and textures, where each bite is a new adventure.
 
 Preparation is a breeze: simply remove your Riced Cauliflower Bowl from its box, cut a one-inch slit in the film covering the bowl, microwave for three minutes, then remove the film, mix it together, and microwave for an additional two or three minutes.
 
 With this level of convenience, the Riced Cauliflower Bowl makes for an ideal work lunch or last-minute dinner. Dress it up even further by adding a few slices of avocado or topping it with a freshly fried egg for an even heartier experience.

Trader Joe’s Olive & Herbs Mixed Nuts only add to this classic snack’s charms via the introduction of tangy, dried Kalamata olives and a suite of aromatic herbs and seasonings to make one truly unique eating experience.   Starting with a hearty base of roasted almonds, cashews, and pecan pieces, our supplier adds an enticingly savory herb blend that includes oregano, sage, thyme, basil, marjoram, and rosemary, along with a bit of sea salt.

 If you're a fan of all things delicious, filling, and nutritious, you might want to head to your local Trader Joe's, because we've got a bread you won't want to miss: Trader Joe's Sprouted Wheat Sourdough Bread.
 
 Our baker begins with organic sprouted wheat berries and a sourdough starter from Northern California. You know how folks say Bay Area sourdough tastes different (even better?) than sourdough from anywhere else? That's the tangy sourdough flavor you'll enjoy in every slice of this Sprouted Wheat Sourdough Bread.
 
 Because this loaf is made with organic sprouted wheat berries (sprouted at the bakery, by the way), as well as both wheat and rye flours, its flavor is more robust, more complex than an ordinary sourdough.

This prized, bright golden-yellow drink can be made with virtually any liquid, but we've opted for a smooth, non-dairy, coconut beverage base in our version- which we're calling, fittingly, Trader Joe's Turmeric Ginger Coconut Beverage.
 
 Crafted with honey, turmeric powder, ginger juice, cinnamon, & black pepper, Trader Joe's Turmeric Ginger Coconut Beverage is a subtly sweet take on a satisfying, spiced classic. It's simultaneously refreshing and comforting and can be enjoyed hot or cold. In most settings, golden milk is enjoyed as a beverage all on its own, but it's beyond lovely in a latte-just use it as a milk substitute.
 
 Trader Joe's Turmeric Ginger Coconut Beverage also makes the perfect base for a chia seed pudding. You can play-up the pudding as you please, but our go-to recipe is as follows: combine 1 cup Turmeric Ginger Coconut Beverage, ¼ cup TJ's Organic Chia Seeds, and 2 teaspoons TJ's Honey in a large bowl; stir the ingredients thoroughly, until all clumps are eliminated; cover the bowl with a TJ's Waxed Cotton Food Wrap; place it in the fridge & leave it to thicken overnight; then serve the pudding chilled, with an optional sprinkle of TJ's Turmeric.","['Beverages', 'Non-Dairy Bev']",https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/turmeric-ginger-coconut-beverage-063805,$2.69,32 Fl Oz,,Kosher,[],,['Glass Half Full'],['1 cup(240mL)'],['80 ']
shea-butter-coconut-oil-hair-serum-064656,Shea Butter & Coconut Oil Hair Serum,"""Hair is the richest ornament."" - Martin Luther
 
 Martin Luther may not be the most relevant cultural icon, but...by golly, did he know hair! Okay, we're totally making that up, but we do appreciate his 16th-century sentiment. Hair is often an integral part of one's identity—one's ornamental crown, if you will.
 
 Certain environmental factors and elective processes (like coloring, perming, straightening, relaxing, etc.) can leave your hair feeling dry, damaged, and/or vulnerable to the elements. And when this is the case, you'll likely need a little something extra to help tame frizz and add shine...something like Trader Joe's Hair Serum.
 
 Infused with shea butter, coconut oil, argan oil, Vitamin E, Pro-Vitamin B5, keratin, and a variety of plant-based extracts (like black currant, açai, & macadamia seed), Trader Joe's Hair Serum is notably silky & moisturizing, yet still lightweight. In other words, it helps add shine and luster to even the dullest of mane, all without weighing it down. It's also free of parabens, sulfates, phthalates, and surfactants (which can strip hair color & affect hair texture) and is never tested on animals.
 
 Our Hair Serum is suitable for all hair types, and it's perfect for use before or after heat styling. Simply follow this cinchy, three-step process: 1) distribute a small amount (one pump or less to start) onto hands; 2) smooth it evenly onto dry or damp hair; 3) revel in the Serum's beachy, coconut-vanilla scent and—more importantly—in your newly softened, shiny tresses!","['Everything Else', 'For the Face & Body']",https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/shea-butter-coconut-oil-hair-serum-064656,$4.99,2.75 Fl Oz,,,[],,"['Treat Yourself', 'Yes!']",[],[]

Instead, each unique shape has its own distinct and delicious flavor: the orange rockfish are orange-flavored; the blue dolphins taste like huckleberry; the yellow sea horses manifest mango-peach in your mouth; and the red lobsters are berry-not any particular berry, mind you, but all the best berries rolled into one.

 Our Organic Kansas City Style BBQ Sauce went through extensive tasting panel review prior to its approval-after all, the old sauce was a customer favorite for a reason! (and eating BBQ week after week wasn't bad, either). Our goal was to emulate the irresistible tanginess of the previous sauce, while at the same time reducing the sugar and balancing the smoke.

Nearly out of ingredients, Caesar whipped together what he had, and the now-classic Caesar Salad was born.
 
 As we quickly approach the Caesar Salad's 100th anniversary (where has the time gone?), the question is raised: how does one properly render tribute to such a sovereign of salads?

All you have to do is make like chef Caesar and mix them all together, and your conquest of dinner is complete.
 
 Like a certain other Caesar we can think of, you may be surprised at just how protean this salad can be-no need to confine it to just a side. Simply add some grilled steak, chicken, or shrimp, and you have a full-fledged entrée. Or, if you're feeling a little more adventurous, using this Caesar Salad as a basis for a flavorful wrap or as the topping to a turkey or salmon burger can turn a plebian sandwich experience into a full-fledged triumph.","['Food', 'Fresh Prepared Foods', 'Salads, Soups & Sides']",https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/organic-caesar-salad-kit-061855,$4.29,12 Oz,,Organic,"['SALAD* (ROMAINE LETTUCE*, CROUTONS* [WHEAT FLOUR*, WATER, SUNFLOWER OIL*, SALT, PARMESAN CHEESE POWDER* {PARMESAN CHEESE (PASTEURIZED MILK*, SALT, CHEESE CULTURES, MICROBIAL ENZYME), DISODIUM PHOSPHATE}, GARLIC*, PALM OIL*, NON-FAT DRY MILK*, DEXTROSE*, SUGAR*, ONIONS*, SPICES*, YEAST*, CITRIC ACID, TRICALCIUM PHOSPHATE, ROSEMARY EXTRACT*]', 'PARMESAN CHEESE* [PASTEURIZED MILK*, CHEESE CULTURE, SALT, MICROBIAL ENZYME, CELLULOSE POWDER {ANTI-CAKING AGENT}])', 'CAESAR DRESSING* (SOYBEAN OIL*, WATER, PARMESAN CHEESE* [PASTEURIZED MILK*, CHEESE CULTURE, SALT, MICROBIAL ENZYME], EGG YOLKS*, DISTILLED WHITE VINEGAR*, DIJON MUSTARD* [APPLE CIDER VINEGAR*, WATER, MUSTARD SEED*, SALT, SPICES*], DRIED GARLIC*, SALT, LEMON JUICE CONCENTRATE*, SUGAR*, BLACK PEPPER*, XANTHAN GUM, MUSTARD FLOUR*). *ORGANIC']","CONTAINS MILK, EGG, SOY , WHEAT.",['Dinner Hack'],['1 1/2 cup(100g) salad plus dressingâ\x80\xa0'],['170 ']

The Italian word focaccia is derived from the original Latin word focus, which referred to the central hearth of a home, where the majority of a family's cooking was done.
 
 Indeed, by definition, focaccia (or panis focacius, as the Romans called it) was associated with the warmth and comfort of home from the very start. In that same tradition, we're setting our focus on the warmth and comfort of this soft, savory bread with Trader Joe's Focaccia Bread with Roasted Tomato & Parmesan.
 
 Harkening back to its Ancient Roman roots, Trader Joe's Focaccia Bread is baked on a heated tile inside of a blazing hot, stone hearth oven. These conditions allow the bread to form the crisp, light crust and soft, airy crumb texture that focaccia is famous for.
 
 Our supplier also upholds an equally important (and delicious) tradition by topping each loaf with extra virgin olive oil, aromatic herbs, flavorful roasted tomatoes, and a generous dusting of finely-grated Parmesan cheese.

Thankfully, her tireless tasting efforts paid off, in the form of Trader Joe's Unsweetened Almond, Cashew & Macadamia Nut Beverage.

The usual suspects (cereal, oatmeal, baked goods, hot tea et al.) would get a beneficial, non-dairy boost from the nutty flavors of this Beverage, no doubt.

But for those in a rush, this kind of ceremonial coffee prep at daybreak is pure fantasy.
 
 While Trader Joe's may not be able to guarantee daily moments of peaceful meditation around the coffee pot, we are doing our part to simplify your coffee making process with our newest addition to our Joe line of coffees, Trader Joe's Joe Light Roast Ground Coffee. It's a full-flavored and easy-going coffee, sold pre-ground to help those seeking to minimize their morning rush.
 
 We start with a blend of 100% Arabica beans from Guatemala and Ethiopia and heat them to an ideal light roast profile: pleasantly light brown in color, mellow aromatics, and roast just enough to bring out the full body and fruitiness of the Ethiopian beans without sacrificing the acidity and sweet notes of the Guatemalan. Then, we grind the beans so you won't have to, just before sealing them into our nitrogen-flushed-for-freshness canister.
 
 This means, at home you'll be able to open the top and immediately spoon fresh grounds into your coffeemaker. No noisy grinder disturbing the peace, and much less counter mess. For the perfect cup, we still recommend approximately two tablespoons of ground coffee for each six ounces of cold water.","['Beverages', 'Coffee & Tea']",https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/joe-light-roast-ground-coffee-062042,$4.99,14 Oz,,Kosher,[],,['Glass Half Full'],[],[]

Enter Trader Joe's Spiced Chai Black Tea Concentrate, the next evolution in our concentrated, caffeinated, bottled beverage set (see TJ's Cold Brew Coffee Concentrate, Coconut Cold Brew Coffee Concentrate, etc.).
 
 Trader Joe's Spiced Chai Black Tea Concentrate is brewed with filtered water and steeped in small batches to fully develop its characteristic flavors-namely, allspice, black pepper, cardamom, clove, cinnamon, and ginger. As chai blends can vary depending on who's doing the blending, we've specifically chosen to highlight ginger in our Black Tea Concentrate. This robust rundown of redolent spices is combined with sugar to create the ideal base for a perfectly perfumed, satisfyingly sweet, and altogether tasty Spiced Chai latte.
 
 This is where you come in: to create the creamiest Spiced Chai latte at home, simply mix two parts of your chosen base (milk or non-dairy beverage) with one part Black Tea Concentrate and give it a stir.

pepita-salsa-062048,Pepita Salsa,"We're famously infatuated with pumpkin. You could call it our bread and butter. Honestly, you could go even farther and call it our Pumpkin Bread and Pumpkin Butter.
 
 But we hope that in all the pumpkin craze, we don't overshadow one of the best parts of the pumpkin, the seed. Pumpkin seeds, also known as pepitas, are an exceptionally crunchy, slightly nutty, deliciously flavorful treat that can bring a serious savory factor to pretty much anything they're added to, be it a pesto sauce, trail mix, or Trader Joe's Pepita Salsa.
 
 By combining the bright, zesty tomato and pepper flavors of a traditional chunky salsa with the texture and nuttiness of finely chopped pepitas, our Pepita Salsa has created a savory synthesis of seed and spice. Not only do the pepitas add a nice thickness to the salsa's body, making it even easier to scoop up with a tortilla or corn chip, but their hearty, earthy flavor expertly balances the acidity of the tomatoes and vinegar.
 
 On top of that, each bite of Pepita Salsa also carries the delicate sweet heat of puréed bell pepper and chipotle spices, making this one seriously satisfying salsa.
 
 Please join us in welcoming Trader Joe's Pepita Salsa to our legendary family of pumpkin products. To celebrate, we recommend using it in any situation that calls for salsa, from a classic chips and salsa appetizer (especially with Trader Joe's Quinoa & Black Bean Infused Tortilla Chips), to a topping for jackfruit tacos, or as the sauce for homemade chilaquiles.

 Neatly wrapped inside each Party Tray are artfully arranged slices of four of our favorite cheeses: Colby Jack, Swiss, Mild Cheddar, and Pepper Jack. Your mission, should you choose to accept it: unwrap that package and put those slices to work!
 
 Having a barbecue? Let your guests choose which cheese shall adorn their burger. Making sandwiches for a crowd? Make that Turkey & Swiss and the Ham & Cheddar without having to open multiple packages of cheese. Want to up your grilled cheese game? Make a melt with all four cheeses on the same sandwich!

Eager to see what the fuss was about, our Buyer tried it for herself, and she was instantly sold on its light, aqueous formula.
 
 What she was not sold on, however, was its $50(!) price tag. She knew TJ's could do better, so she contacted one of our favorite high-end skincare producers—a company overseen by a panel of board-certified dermatologists—and the rest is epidermal history.
 
 Trader Joe's Ultra Hydrating Gel Moisturizer is the moisturizing deluge your pretty, parched visage has been thirsting for. The water-based gel formula is packed with skin-soothing ingredients, like aloe leaf juice and green tea, birch leaf, & milk thistle extracts.

 Well, if you're allergic to peanuts, plenty!  It was this gap in salty, nutty-flavored, chocolatey candy offerings for the peanut-averse that inspired our product developer to create Trader Joe's Dark Chocolate Sunflower Seed Butter Cups, the newest addition to our candy set.
 
 The Cups themselves are formed with rich, fair trade Dark Chocolate, and measure about two inches in diameter. Encased in each Cup is a thick layer of Sunflower Seed Butter, which has been salted and sweetened just enough to avoid the bitterness that sometimes accompanies plain sunflower seed butter.
 
 This magical merger of dark chocolate and salty seed butter masterfully mimics the craveable creaminess of a peanut butter cup, without peanuts!

avocado-tzatziki-dip-062525,Avocado Tzatziki Dip,"Once upon a time, one of our favorite domestic fresh foods suppliers traveled to Greece in search of unique foods that weren't readily available in the U.S. What they found was Tzatzik (say zaht-ZEE-kee)i, a creamy garlic-cucumber-mint dip that's part of the fabric of Greek cuisine, and they worked closely with our Buyers to recreate a version exclusively for Trader Joe's, made with Greek yogurt, which we've been selling ever since.
 
 Fast-forward some twenty-plus years to the present. Many things have changed, but not our Customers' love of Tzatziki. So our Buyer had a thought: why not combine this TJ's classic with something new? Perhaps, she thought, with a food that's rich and creamy, filled with healthy fats, and seemingly hipper than ever: the avocado.
 
 She tinkered with the recipe for months-settling on a 30% freshly diced avocado base and ultimately adding some diced jalapeños to the list of inclusions-and new Trader Joe's Avocado Tzatziki Dip is the tangy, creamy, and totally addictive fruit of her labor.
 
 Trader Joe's Avocado Tzatziki is a super dip for veggies or chips. It's perfect for pita. And it's surprisingly scrumptious on salads and in sandwiches.

 Based primarily on the flavors of allspice and hot red peppers, jerk seasoning is traditionally used on milder-flavored proteins like chicken or pork, but we find that it works equally well as a snack-enhancer. Need proof? Look no further than Trader Joe's Jerk-Style Plantain Chips.
 
 Drawing inspiration from classic Jamaican cooking, our Jerk-Style Plantain Chips pair the satisfying crunch of a plantain chip with the multitude of flavors of jerk seasoning. Each individual Chip is covered in a generous dusting of jerk cooking-inspired herbs and spices, including allspice, garlic powder, cinnamon, coriander, nutmeg, and ginger extract.
 
 What you'll likely notice above all other flavors, however, is the increasing heat of spicy red chili pepper powder.

With all these options, we still noticed a gap-and it's one that Trader Joe's Ready to Drink Cold Brew Coffee fills to the rim.
 
 It comes in a large-format bottle (multiple servings), similar to our Concentrates. However, unlike the Concentrates, this bottle's contents require no dilution with water!
 
 More precisely, what you'll find inside is small-batch Cold Brew Coffee made using an authentic cold-brew process that includes 100% Arabica beans from Colombia that are air-roasted and ground, then steeped in cold water for at least 12 hours. What it doesn't include is any reconstituted coffee, additives, or preservatives.
 
 And, just as the cold-brew-coffee connoisseur would expect, the flavor here is bold & rich, with a smooth body, and significantly less acid than hot-brewed java. With that acid and bitterness out of the way, you can really catch the hints of molasses, and notes of walnut and cocoa offered in this premium brew.

organic-earl-grey-tea-062680,Organic Earl Grey Tea,"Thanks to its versatility in food pairing, and brisk, delightful flavor whether served hot or cold, Earl Grey is one of the most popular tea flavors around. But given its widespread availability, how does one wade through the ho-hum blends out there to find a high quality cuppa that boils up with the best of them? Why, step inside your neighborhood Trader Joe's, of course!
 
 Trader Joe's Organic Earl Grey Tea is a deceptively simple, organic blend of bold, full-bodied black tea from South India, balanced with an invigorating, floral black tea from Africa. The addition of oil from organic Italian Bergamot oranges lends a citrusy, heady aroma (think of Bergamot as the Meyer lemon's warm, spicy cousin) and brightens the flavor of its black tea counterparts.
 
 This juxtaposition creates a smooth cup that's enjoyable no matter the time of day. (And if the time of day happens to be teatime, may we suggest serving Organic Earl Grey Tea alongside sandwiches made with Trader Joe's Curry Chicken Salad (crusts removed, of course) and Mini Orange Cranberry Tea Scones?)
 
 For an expertly brewed cup of hot Earl Grey, pour boiling water over a tea bag and brew for 3-5 minutes, then remove the tea bag and add sweetener, or follow British tradition and serve with a squeeze of fresh lemon. If you're on Team Iced Tea, the prep is similarly simple: pour four cups boiling water over 3-5 tea bags and steep for 3-5 minutes, then remove tea bags and pour over ice-filled glasses.","['Beverages', 'Coffee & Tea']",https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/organic-earl-grey-tea-062680,$2.99,20 Bag,,Kosher,"['ORGANIC BLACK TEA', 'ORGANIC BERGAMOT OIL']",,"['Glass Half Full', 'Rain or Shine', 'Rise & Shine']",[],[]

 Warm, savory, and filled with satisfyingly silky textures, you'd be hard-pressed to find a more comforting comfort food than pho (pronounced fuh, for the record). Since its creation in late 19th century Vietnam, pho has turned into a certified foodie phenomenon, and a staple of noodle shop menus the world over. Of course, one doesn't always have quick access to a noodle shop, nor the time to prepare pho from scratch, which is why we're introducing Trader Joe's Beef Pho Soup, a traditionally-inspired, sensationally-seasoned, heat-and-serve way to get your pho fix in a matter of minutes.
 
 Every bowl of our Beef Pho Soup is made with tender, seasoned beef, perfectly-textured rice noodles, and a rich, lively broth flavored with aromatic herbs like basil and cilantro. With just six minutes in the microwave or ten minutes on the stovetop, this Pho is ready to serve with your choice of toppings: we like thinly sliced jalapeños and basil, ourselves. Its ease of preparation and homey, satisfying character make it a great candidate for a quick lunch at the office or home.","['Food', 'From The Freezer', 'Entrées & Sides']",https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/beef-pho-065920,$3.49,13.23 Oz,,,[],"CONTAINS SOY ,  ANCHOVY.","['Dinner Hack', 'Feeling Adventurous', 'Rain or Shine']",['1 bowl(375g)'],['220 ']

Added to this base are jojoba, peppermint, tea tree, and eucalyptus oils. There are also some dried mint leaves that give the white bar an attractive, green-flecked appearance. What this Bar doesn't have is parabens or sulfates!
 
 This combination not only thoroughly cleans hair, it also creates a truly satisfying shampooing experience.

You can definitely taste the blueberry-ness of the blueberries and the strawberry-ness of the strawberries. Even the raspberries retain their raspberry-ness!
 
 Of course, while the naturally sweet & tart flavors remain true, the soft juiciness of non-dried fruit is replaced by a wonderfully light crunch. This means the Berry Medley is ideal for snacking, or for topping yogurt. Mix it with your favorite nuts to create a berry-licious trail mix. Sprinkle a handful over a bowl of ice cream. Throw some in your smoothie for a formidable fruit boost. Or use it to amp up a dish of TJ's Belgian chocolate pudding.

That's precisely the feeling we intend to invoke with Trader Joe's Blueberry Muffins, a four-pack of light, cakey muffins, each filled with a bountiful bunch of blueberries and topped with a sprinkling of crunchy sugar.
 
 Blueberry muffins are a true classic of the muffin category, and Trader Joe's Blueberry Muffins play to every one of the genre's strengths: a crumbly, cakey texture, delightful hints of lemon zest, and, of course, an abundance of wild and cultivated blueberries in each bite. While they're perfectly delicious when enjoyed as a quick, on-the-go breakfast snack or brunch side, we contend that they truly excel when heated up a bit in the toaster oven or microwave - the aromatics of warm blueberries alone are well worth the price of admission.

 Boatswain American I.P.A. lives up to two of those three descriptors - once you have a taste of it, it certainly won't go unnoticed.

 You may also be thinking, Didn't Trader Joe's carry this product once before?  Well, we did, and to be honest, sales weren't exactly spectacular. But given how popular our frozen Indian items are (not to mention how delicious this Paratha is), we decided we simply had to give it another chance to shine. Alas, we digress. Onto the Paratha itself!
 
 One difference between the aforementioned Naan and Trader Joe's Malabari Paratha is in the ingredients. Our Malabari Paratha (made in the tradition of the Malabar region of Southern India) includes wheat flour, cow's & buffalo's milk, and a little bit of sugar & salt. In contrast, traditional Naan typically incorporates yogurt and yeast in its recipe.
 
 Another difference is in the way these breads are formed. Our Paratha (like traditional Paratha) is formed by hand using a unique process in which thin rounds of dough are rolled into long ropes, which are then rolled into spirals that kind of look like cinnamon buns. Finally, they are pressed back into flattened rounds. (Paratha literally means ""layers of cooked flour."")
 
 More simply, Naan dough is flattened as it's slapped on the inside of the Tandoori oven to cook-which leads to the final difference: Trader Joe's Malabari Paratha is cooked on flat, griddle-like stoves.
 
 Heat our Malabari Paratha from frozen in a lightly oiled, non-stick pan until golden, and you'll find a bite that is crisp on the outside and soft & moist on the inside.

 Imported from Parma, Italy, this Uncured Salame is sliced and packaged in the U.S.A. to ensure the freshest product possible. But before it makes its way across the Atlantic, the pork is slowly aged in the air of the Italian Apennine Mountains, which creates an ideal climate for drying and aging meat.

And there are no nitrates or nitrites added, except for those naturally occurring in celery juice and sea salt.
 
 For an Italian snack trifecta, pair this Salame with a few other things Italy is known for: freshly sliced Trader Joes's Parmigiano Reggiano and a bottle of Chianti. Its mild flavor makes it a must-have when putting together a cheese plate. Roll up a slice and slide it on a toothpick with pickled vegetables for an easy, party-worthy appetizer.

 If you're looking to lessen the nutritional impact that accompanies said side dish, however, it can be tough to find a creamy replacement that stands up to the might of the mashed potato on a dinner plate. Enter Trader Joe's Mashed Cauliflower.
 
 To give this dish dimension, our supplier utilizes not one, but two different cuts of cauliflower-in fact, cauliflower accounts for more than 70% of the recipe! Blanched cauliflower bits are simmered with skim milk, half & half and butter for creaminess, and then rice flour, garlic, salt and pepper are added to create a velvety purée.
 
 Finally, larger chunks of cauliflower florets are added to give this Mash toothsome texture. When the mixture has cooled, it's punctiliously portioned into petite pucks, so you can prepare what you need when you need it, and save the rest for later. Mashtastic!

And with that in mind, we've created a new seasoning salt to celebrate these flavorful alliums: Trader Joe's Onion Salt.
 
 It may be called Onion Salt, but it has a few other alliums that, in our opinion, make this seasoning truly special. Granulated onion makes up the majority of this spice, but there's also granulated garlic, minced onion, kosher salt, green onion, and dried chives.

The plethora of meal options in our freezer cases is a testament to this convergence of convenience and enjoyment-why stand over a hot stove or cutting board (and later, the kitchen sink) when you have tasty, pre-prepped meal components, ready to heat and eat at a moment's notice?
 
 Trader Joe's Riced Cauliflower Stir Fry is the newest addition to our user-friendly frozen lineup. A boon to the home cook, it starts with a base of blanched, toothsome cauliflower crumbles seasoned with savory tamari sauce and nutty sesame oil. Green peas, red bell peppers, grilled corn, and spring onions are added for fresh, vegetal flavor and vibrant color.
 
 Were you to create this dish from scratch, you'd be looking at close to an hour of prep & cook time. With a bag of this Stir Fry in hand, however, you're mere minutes away from a filling, flavorful side dish.
 
 Simply heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a non-stick skillet, add stir fry and cook until warmed through, 6 to 7 minutes. Top with the cooked protein of your choice, and that side dish becomes a hearty meal (we especially like it topped with a fried egg, sliced avocado, and a generous squirt of TJ's Sriracha Sauce).","['Food', 'From The Freezer', 'Entrées & Sides']",https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/riced-cauliflower-stir-fry-060024,$3.79,16 Oz,,,[],CONTAINS SOY.,['Time-pressed'],['1 cup(105g)'],['50 ']

At Trader Joe's, they're called Chicken & Mushroom Pelmeni, and they're a convenient means of getting a dumpling dinner on the table in a flash.
 
 Trader Joe's Chicken & Mushroom Pelmeni are classic dough-wrapped pockets, made in Southern California and assembled in Russian tradition. Stuffed with flavorful chicken thighs and earthy mushrooms, these morsels are further seasoned with tender onion, herbaceous dill and tangy sour cream to round out their traditional flavor profile-simple, savory, satisfying.
 
 Almost as simple as the ingredient listing is their prep: boil these Pelmeni in salted water for 3 to 4 minutes until they float, and serve with melted butter, sour cream or your favorite sauce. Take them a step further with a pan fry (post-boil) for a golden, tender-crisp appetizer-not unlike pan-fried gyoza.

Candy-coated milk chocolates are the first ingredient, in a rainbow of colors: blue, green, orange, red, and yellow. Unlike other mixes on the market, the chocolate candy shells are colored with naturally available ingredients (turmeric, spirulina and red radish powder) that are mixed with coconut wax for celestial shine. Roasted & salted peanuts and almonds add loads of nutty crunch, and California raisins provide chewy texture and sweet, sun-kissed flavor.
 
 This Mix is ready to sustain you in a mythological battle—or more accurately, squash snack cravings.

Soon to join the ranks of awe-inducing, seasoning superstars in kitchens everywhere is Trader Joe’s Smoked Paprika.
 
 Our kosher certified Smoked Paprika is produced for us on the eastern coast of Spain, in warm Valencia, where our supplier has been working with paprika since 1945. Spanish-grown sweet red peppers are slowly roasted over hard wood planks to imbue this spice with its characteristic smokiness. The peppers are ground into a fine, super flavorful, brick red powder, and then packed into tins with a combination shaker/teaspoon lid, so you can use as much or as little as you like.
 
 When you’re ready to unleash the power of Smoked Paprika, season liberally during cooking—add it to grilled shrimp, roasted chicken thighs, corn on the cob, French fries, paella… anywhere you want smoky, mildly sweet pepper flavor.

Well, Trader Joe's isn't planning on going on raids or building an empire (unless that empire is selling high-quality, delicious foods at low prices), but both have traveled the world trading goods, and... crispbread.
 
 It is believed that crispbread can be traced back to the Vikings, who stored it on ships for long journeys across sea. They lived on spare diets in terms of crops and produce due to the cold weather, but crispbread was one food that brought them sustenance. Our buyers foraged (a more exciting way to say ""worked"") for months to get their hands on the perfect Trader Joe's Whole Grain Crispbread, and succeed they did.
 
 But then we began to wonder... What about the gluten-intolerant Vikings? Surely they, too, would have enjoyed and benefited from a hearty Crispbread from time to time, right? Well, while we can't amend the past, we can enhance the present - with Trader Joe's Gluten Free Crispbread.
 
 You may not be journeying for months on a knar (Viking merchant ship) anytime soon, but we think our made-in-Norway Gluten Free Crispbread will be an excellent addition to your everyday diet. Its ingredients include sunflower, sesame, and flax seeds; oat flakes; rice bran; potato fiber; and a few other straightforward additions, like salt and a touch of honey. With 4g of protein and 3g of fiber per cracker, a Viking could live off of these! They're mildly salty and totally seedy - with a coarse, crumbly, oh-so-gratifying crunch.

 Unlike our previous, two-cheese incarnation, Trader Joe's Gluten Free Mac & Cheese is now made with the exact same four-cheese blend you'll find in our beloved Diner Mac-Cheddar, Swiss, Havarti, & Gouda, all made with milk from cows not treated with rBST. We also add milk & a house-made, gluten free béchamel to this four-cheese blend, which makes for a comforting creation that's extra thick & creamy.
 
 And lest we miss the mac for the cheese (as they say), we've taken equally great care in selecting the perfect pasta: a corkscrew-shaped Rotini made with a blend of corn, rice, lentil, & quinoa flours. The end result? A toothsome, weighty Gluten Free Mac & Cheese that's just as delish as any of its wheat-pasta compatriots-think, ""Wow, are you sure that's gluten free?!"" not, ""Wow, that sure is gluten free...""

chipotle-vegetable-quesadillas-061365,Chipotle Vegetable Quesadillas,"It used to be that the word ""vegetarian"" was synonymous with the word ""bland."" Restaurants and food manufacturers would replace the meat in a dish with a handful of overcooked broccoli, or a mushy vegetable ""patty,"" and call it a day.
 
 Thankfully times have changed, and folks looking to avoid a meat-based meal (on Monday, or any other day) have more options out there, with more flavor than ever before. Options like Trader Joe's Chipotle Vegetable Quesadillas.
 
 Made for us in sunny southern California, our Chipotle Vegetable Quesadillas are the answer to your lunch cravings, dinner yearnings or late night hunger pangs. Our supplier starts with a hand-stretched flour tortilla, and packs it with gooey Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheeses.
 
 They then take dried, smoked jalapeños and marinate them in a seasoned sauce of garlic and tomato-this is what puts the ""chipotle"" in Chipotle Vegetable Quesadilla. Savory onions, black beans and sweet corn are folded into the smoky, spiced sauce, and the mixture is then layered into the cheesy tortilla, which is then pressed to deliciousness-without a handful of broccoli or veggie patty in sight!
 
 These Quesadillas cook up beautifully in the microwave; if you go the stove or oven prep route, you'll end up with crispy tortilla edges that provide a pleasant counterpoint to the smoky cheesiness within. And while that smoky, cheesy goodness is delicious on its own, a little guacamole and sour cream on the side couldn't hurt.","['Food', 'From The Freezer', 'Entrées & Sides']",https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/chipotle-vegetable-quesadillas-061365,$3.69,12 Oz,,,[],"CONTAINS MILK, WHEAT.",['In Lieu of Pizza'],"['1 quesadilla(170g)', '1 quesadilla(170g)']","['360 ', '710 ']"

Without further adieu, we're pleased to welcome Trader Joe's Part Skim Ricotta Cheese to our cheese case.
 
 To find a Part Skim Ricotta Cheese aligned with Trader Joe's standards (tastes excellent, offers amazing value, and made with milk from cows not treated with rBST), our product developer went to Wisconsin, a state that's second to none when it comes to cheese-making capability. The cheese monger combines pasteurized whey, cream, milk, vinegar and a touch of salt to produce a cheese that's rich, creamy and slightly grainy in texture, with a fresh, slightly sweet flavor. 
 
 The clean, versatile flavor of Part Skim Ricotta Cheese leaves it open to all sorts of culinary interpretation. Enjoy it with a few cracks of salt & pepper, olive oil and chopped fresh herbs. Bake it into a rigatoni casserole with spicy sausage and marinara. Its slight sweetness lends itself to dessert as well-may we suggest a fancy, fresh ricotta parfait with sliced strawberries and a drizzle of Trader Joe's Honey?

milk-dark-chocolate-butterscotch-bits-bar-061490,Milk & Dark Chocolate Butterscotch Bits Bar,"As far as confectionary conflicts go, few battles have raged as passionately or as endlessly as the rivalry between milk and dark chocolate. For ages, milk chocolate aficionados have pointed to the smoothness and accessibility of a classic milk chocolate bar, while dark chocolate devotees have countered with the bold and bracing flavors that only the dark side can provide.
 
 We're happy to report that these arguments may be set aside in favor of cooperation, collaboration, and caramelization in the form of Trader Joe's Milk & Dark Chocolate Butterscotch Bits Bar, a candy concord between milk and dark chocolate, brokered by the presence of crunchy bits of butterscotch.
 
 Upon unwrapping a Milk & Dark Chocolate Butterscotch Bits Bar from its appropriately marbled packaging, you'll see that its commitment to cocoa harmony extends even to its appearance: a perfect swirl of milk and dark chocolate, segmented into easy-to-break-off, even-easier-to-share triangular pieces. And, of course, each bite only furthers that spirit of unity, with the milk chocolate laying a smooth, creamy foundation, upon which the dark chocolate builds striking cocoa flavor which intermingles superbly with the sugary crunch of flawlessly dispersed granules of butterscotch. Truly, teamwork makes the dream work.
 
 While there's never a bad time or situation to enjoy a candy bar of this caliber, Trader Joe's Milk & Dark Chocolate Butterscotch Bits Bar's shareability and easy portioning make it an excellent choice for movie screenings, binge watch parties, or as a companion for long road trips and air travel.

cauliflower-gnocchi-061524,Cauliflower Gnocchi,"Calling all cauliflower lovers! If you've been enjoying our ongoing experimentations with this brassica-we've riced it, mashed it, grilled it, and put it into patties & pizza crusts-our latest adaptation is likely to gnoc your socks off...
 
 Trader Joe's Cauliflower Gnocchi (NYOK-kee) is made for us in Italy, and it's quite like those traditional Italian dumplings made of mashed potato, flour, and egg-hence, the Gnocchi designation. This version, however, is made with about 75% cauliflower, as well as cassava flour, potato starch, extra virgin olive oil, and sea salt. No wheat, sugar, dairy, or eggs are included here, and that translates to fewer carbs, with significantly less fat & calories than potato-based varieties.
 
 Our Italian supplier, who specializes in regular gnocchi, uses the cauliflower they've grown in their own fields to create soft-textured bites that are easy to prepare. Sauté and crisp-up in a stovetop pan-our favorite prep method that requires no thawing and results in crisp, never-overcooked Gnocchi.
 
 You can alternatively boil or microwave them for a more tender presentation. And like other gnocchi you've known, these are tasty tossed in butter, fresh sage, and TJ's Shaved Parmesan Reggiano. Or, if you prefer, Rustico Pomodoro Pasta Sauce and fresh basil. Any way is a good way to dress up our Cauliflower Gnocchi.

Take, for instance, our oh-so-popular Black Bean and Jack Cheese Burrito: the tortilla perfectly hugs the beans and cheese, keeping them safe until you're ready to enjoy. Now, when you use breakfast ingredients instead of beans and cheese, it's a real game-changer (or breakfast-changer).
 
 Our Trader Joe's Chicken Sausage Breakfast Burrito aptly contains all the important breakfast ingredients necessary to deem this breakfast-worthy. We went after tradition: chicken sausage flavored with sage and thyme, scrambled eggs, potatoes, sautéed onions, and white cheddar cheese live inside a chewy flour tortilla. The proportions are just right, so you'll get a little bit of everything in each bite. And, though it is a Breakfast Burrito, you don't have to restrict the time of day in which you enjoy it-it's always delicious.
 
 Maybe the best part about this Breakfast Burrito (after the Burrito itself, of course) is the endless condiment possibilities that lay before you. Do you like Organic Ketchup to accompany your breakfast? If you're from the southwest, you're probably reaching for the Salsa Autentica the second you hear ""breakfast.""

We can thank Josephine Cochrane for making this chore a little less nettlesome: she invented the first commercially viable dishwasher in 1886. Yes, well over 100 years ago! Dishwashers are just as useful as ever, but are only as successful as the cleaning agents you use in them. Trader Joe's Dishwasher Detergent Gel is ready and up to the toughest dish washing tasks.
 
 Our Dishwasher Detergent Gel is made with a premium plant-based formula that uses a powerful enzyme system to make short work of whatever's waiting in your dishwasher. The non-toxic formula has a pleasant lemon scent from essential oils and botanical extracts (with no harsh fumes), and it contains no phosphates or chlorine.
 
 As a USDA-certified biobased product, our Dishwasher Gel is composed of biological products and renewable materials. Whereas most dishwasher detergents are mainly petroleum based, this Detergent is made with 65% biobased products.
 
 To get those dishes squeaky-clean, simply load dishwasher-safe items in your dishwasher, fill the dispenser cup 1/2 to 2/3 full and pour into machine. (Pro-tip: Silver, aluminum, and stainless steel should be washed in separate loads to avoid discoloration.) Voila!

Next, we add chickpeas, which have been cooked and marinated in olive oil, then seasoned with chili powder, garlic powder, oregano, salt, & cumin. And for the final, finishing touch, we add a little sambal oelek red chili paste, a bit of tamari soy sauce, and a cool, creamy tahini sauce to tie all the flavors together. The result is a journey through a plethora of tastes and textures, where each bite is a new adventure.
 
 Preparation is a breeze: simply remove your Riced Cauliflower Bowl from its box, cut a one-inch slit in the film covering the bowl, microwave for three minutes, then remove the film, mix it together, and microwave for an additional two or three minutes.

shea-butter-coconut-oil-hair-serum-064656,Shea Butter & Coconut Oil Hair Serum,"""Hair is the richest ornament."" - Martin Luther
 
 Martin Luther may not be the most relevant cultural icon, but...by golly, did he know hair! Okay, we're totally making that up, but we do appreciate his 16th-century sentiment. Hair is often an integral part of one's identity—one's ornamental crown, if you will.
 
 Certain environmental factors and elective processes (like coloring, perming, straightening, relaxing, etc.) can leave your hair feeling dry, damaged, and/or vulnerable to the elements. And when this is the case, you'll likely need a little something extra to help tame frizz and add shine...something like Trader Joe's Hair Serum.
 
 Infused with shea butter, coconut oil, argan oil, Vitamin E, Pro-Vitamin B5, keratin, and a variety of plant-based extracts (like black currant, açai, & macadamia seed), Trader Joe's Hair Serum is notably silky & moisturizing, yet still lightweight. In other words, it helps add shine and luster to even the dullest of mane, all without weighing it down.

 One on the one hand (or shall we say fin), these are typical gummy candies-colorful, sweet, and chewy. On the other, they really are quite extraordinary for a number of reasons...
 
 First, their vibrant hues are not only visually striking, they are also made with colors derived only from naturally available products, such as fruit and vegetable extracts. Second, though they are definitely chewy, they are also softer than many gummies, making each bite a tender delight.
 
 Third, the flavors are truly out-of-this-ocean! (Seriously, there are no seafood flavors here.) Instead, each unique shape has its own distinct and delicious flavor: the orange rockfish are orange-flavored; the blue dolphins taste like huckleberry; the yellow sea horses manifest mango-peach in your mouth; and the red lobsters are berry-not any particular berry, mind you, but all the best berries rolled into one.

Its tangy, sweet-smokiness instantly ups the ante on grilled meat, ribs, and chicken, commanding center of the plate attention with the flick of a basting brush. Our Kansas City Style BBQ Sauce was a longtime resident on our shelves that upheld this meaty tradition with aplomb, but over the years, its ingredient deck started to fall out of line with current trends. Retiring this old standby allowed us to make room for a new sauce that we think will be an instant classic: Trader Joe's Organic Kansas City Style BBQ Sauce.
 
 Our Organic Kansas City Style BBQ Sauce went through extensive tasting panel review prior to its approval-after all, the old sauce was a customer favorite for a reason! (and eating BBQ week after week wasn't bad, either). Our goal was to emulate the irresistible tanginess of the previous sauce, while at the same time reducing the sugar and balancing the smoke. We think we accomplished it, with a base of tomato puree, brown sugar and molasses for tang and sweetness, amped up with natural hickory smoke flavor. Onion powder and garlic powder add savory notes, rounded out by paprika and chipotle powder for a smoky finish.

And, on the other hand, sometimes you don't always have the time to put the ingredients together, yourself. That's why we're introducing Trader Joe's Shakshuka Starter: everything you need to create a steamy, slightly spicy Shakshuka in just about five minutes - all that's required on your end are a pair of fresh eggs and a microwave.

Preparation could not be simpler: just puncture the film on your tray of frozen Shakshuka, microwave for three minutes, then peel back the film and crack two fresh eggs directly into the stew, and microwave again for another two minutes, or until your desired doneness of the eggs has been achieved.

After a bit of a hiatus, you'll find this relative of our reigning Customer Choice Awards champion (commonly known as Mandarin Orange Chicken) back in our freezer case where it belongs. Because our Orange Chicken is so wildly popular, we're happy to say our vegan customers will once again have the chance to experience the deliciousness.
 
 This offering, of course, involved removing ""chicken"" from the equation. And that involved some tinkering—but we love tinkering. One of the best things about these Morsels is that if you didn't know they weren't chicken, you'd probably think they were chicken. But because they're not chicken, but rather a chicken-y blend of soy, this Asian inspired entrée is suitable-and quite delectable-for vegetarians and vegans alike.
 
 This Chicken-less version, of course, includes that beloved sauce that's sweet, a little spicy, and perfectly complements the meaty-tasting Morsels. Cook according to the directions on the package, and then serve with noodles or rice and your favorite green veggies for a complete, easy, meat-free meal. (Our favorite is over Brown Rice and sautéed Bok Choy, garnished with sliced Green Onions.)

 What she was not sold on, however, was its $50(!) price tag. She knew TJ's could do better, so she contacted one of our favorite high-end skincare producers—a company overseen by a panel of board-certified dermatologists—and the rest is epidermal history.

The wonder comes in the way the semi-sweetness of the smooth, rich, dark chocolate (not accidentally from Belgium) contrasts with the crisp crunch of the Cookie and its muted saltiness.

mixed-mushroom-spinach-quiche-055970,Mixed Mushroom & Spinach Quiche,"The Lorraine region in northeastern France is associated with numerous notable cuisines. Potato stew, smoked bacon, macarons, and madeleines all have roots of origin, or development in Lorraine-but what first comes to mind is their most famous dish, the quiche.
 
 While this region's namesake quiche contains bacon, we sought a meatless version-still hoping to convey the richness of flavor that comes with the original. To do so, we traveled to the source (of course!) and found French bakers with the traditional knowledge & skills needed to create Trader Joe's Mixed Mushrooms & Spinach Quiche.
 
 The crust is made with wheat flour and real butter. The savory custard center consists of eggs, crème fraîche, and Emmental Swiss, with chopped spinach, and a blend of White Button & Oyster mushrooms. Just the right amount of salt, and nutmeg (that not-so-secret, secret ingredient) help delicately balance all the flavors.
 
 The umami of the mushrooms, combined with the rich custard makes for a wonderfully satisfying meal. Add a simple side salad of Champs Elysees greens, and a glass of Révélation Chardonnay, and you might as well be having lunch at a Metz café. It'll cost you much less, though.

Hemp has been used for centuries to make clothing, rope, and paper-and the seeds of the plant have been used in baking and even to make beverages, as in Trader Joe's Unsweetened Non-Dairy Hemp Beverage.
 
 Our Beverage is very simply a base of shelled hemp seeds that have been crushed and blended with water. (Think almond ""milk,"" but with hemp seeds instead of almonds.) Added to that is a little sea salt for balanced flavor and some emulsifiers to provide a silky-smooth texture. The aroma and taste is slightly nutty; even bean-y, if you will. In fact, it's surprisingly refreshing!

 Plantains are close relatives of bananas. While you normally eat bananas raw, plantains are almost always cooked before eating. Where bananas are sweet, plantains are on the starchy side. And though plantains are technically a fruit, they're commonly eaten like root vegetables. When you think of them this way, Trader Joe's Plantain Chips make perfect sense.
 
 Our Plantain Chips come from Peru, where the plantains are picked when they're just ripe enough to be slightly sweet. They're sliced and cooked in sunflower oil, then dusted with salt. They eat like sort-of-sweet, thick-cut potato chips, but with less fat than typical potato chips.

Or any dairy, for that matter-these Mochi are totally non-dairy and totally tasty.
 
 Thai Tea Mini Mochi begin with a thin, tender, outer layer of mochi made with glutinous* rice flour. Inside that delicate wrapper is a creamy nugget of frozen, ice-cream-like dessert flavored with a strong black tea that's native to Northern Thailand.
 
 The unique, delicate flavor of our Thai Tea Mini Mochi is inspired by cha-yen-a traditional, Thai drink that's made with strongly brewed black (or Ceylon) tea, sugar, and condensed milk and served over ice.

yellow-jackfruit-curry-with-jasmine-rice-059976,Yellow Jackfruit Curry with Jasmine Rice,"You could say jackfruit is having a moment. And we could say, if we were prone to hyperbole and self-aggrandizement, that Trader Joe's has been instrumental in orchestrating that moment. What we will say, clearly, is that the early and exciting success of our Green Jackfruit in Brine led us to the realization that American palates have an appetite for jackfruit. And that realization led us to the creation of Trader Joe's Yellow Jackfruit Curry with Jasmine Rice.
 
 Jackfruit grows in abundance in Thailand, which is where our supplier is located. They've sourced green (unripe) jackfruit here; at this stage in the ripening process, the fruit cooks to a meat-like consistency and mild flavor that's ready to take on the flavor of any sauce.
 
 Here, we've paired it with a creamy, coconut milk-based yellow curry sauce, created in-house with a yellow curry paste rich in freshly ground herbs and spices including lemongrass, cumin, and turmeric. To release the fragrant aromatics, the curry paste is cooked over medium heat, then slowly simmered with coconut milk to create a rich, vibrantly flavored sauce. That sauce is the perfect partner to tender pieces of jackfruit and chunks of eggplant and red bell pepper.
 
 And what's a curry without rice? Incomplete, that's what. So we've included a sidecar of white jasmine rice; its fragrant aroma and slightly chewy texture make it the ideal carbohydrate companion for this easy to heat and enjoy entrée.","['Food', 'From The Freezer', 'Entrées & Sides']",https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/yellow-jackfruit-curry-with-jasmine-rice-059976,$2.99,13 Oz,,Vegan,[],CONTAINS COCONUT.,"['Time-pressed', 'Unexpected']",['1 tray(370g)'],['470 ']

 We felt our collection of crusts could be even better with inclusion of a vegetable-based version, namely, a cauliflower crust. So, our Product Innovator traveled to Italy in search of a cauliflower crust worthy of the Trader Joe's name, and came back with Trader Joe's Cauliflower Pizza Crust.
 
 Italian tradition meets modern nutrition in this tale of pizza crust progression. Nutty, riced cauliflower and corn flour form the sturdy base of this gluten free Crust. Unlike others on the market that are held together with eggs or cheese (thus, high in calories), this Crust is held together with cornstarch, potato starch, olive oil and sea salt.
 
 How to best enjoy this veggie-centric crust? The key is in the prep: bake it in a 450 degree oven without toppings, and once its crisped to your liking, add your desired toppings and broil for a few minutes more.

It was good, as sauces go, but it never really set the world on fire. You see, this sauce had a bit of an identity crisis. It contained some nontraditional ingredients, along with gums, soy, and wheat.
 
 So, we set out to create a sauce that would exceed expectations, full of zesty green curry flavor-and in doing so, we were able to provide a better value for our customers. Yay! Without further adieu, allow us to reintroduce Trader Joe's Thai Green Curry Simmer Sauce.
 
 Our Product Innovator went straight to the source in Thailand to create this Thai Green Curry Simmer Sauce. It starts with a base of velvety coconut milk, and an incredibly flavorful, spicy green curry paste. Packed into this paste are shallots, lemongrass, garlic, galangal, coriander seed, Thai lime peel, ginger, turmeric and cumin-all contributing to its savory, aromatic awesomeness. The Sauce is rounded out with rice bran oil, sugar, basil leaf and green chili for just the right amount of heat.
 
 To get your fill of Green Curry goodness, sauté a half-pound of your favorite protein or tofu until cooked through. Add an equal amount of vegetables to the pan, and then cover everything in this Sauce. Simmer until hot and vegetables are tender, and then serve over rice or noodles.

So the next time you're craving walnut shrimp, don't try to find the time to create it from scratch or call for takeout, check out Trader Joe's Honey Walnut Shrimp in our freezer case.
 
 Inspired by numerous restaurant versions of this dish, we set out to create an easy-to-make iteration you could have on the table in less time than it would take to have it delivered. What we found with some of the restaurant versions was an abundance of batter, and pretty small shrimp. We're using large shrimp and a batter that lightly coats the shrimp, yet manages to retain its crunch even after it's been combined with the sauce. (Comparable restaurant versions are 40% batter; ours are 30% batter.)
 
 Speaking of the sauce, it's a sweet, creamy concoction that's finished with a hint of pineapple to give the flavor a bright boost. And we couldn't have Honey Walnut Shrimp without walnuts, right? Every package contains candied walnuts you toss with the shrimp and sauce before serving. All of the components are packaged separately, and the bag has detailed instructions that will yield delicious results.

 Our new Mini Vegetable Samosas are two-bite sized, three-sided savory pastries with a crisp exterior that’s made from a special Phyllo-type dough that creates a multilayered, flaky package for the filling. Speaking of the filling, each triangle is packed corner-to-corner with a curry-like mixture of peas, carrots, potatoes, lentils, onions, and Indian spices. In fact, the filling makes up about 50% of each samosa (versus about 35% in other brands). The vegetables are tender and mildly spicy, offering warm flavors redolent of the Indian subcontinent.
 
 On top of all that, it’s worth noting that these Samosas’ nutritional profile (see nutrition facts below) is pretty darn reasonable for a savory pastry.

plantain-croutons-066408,Plantain Croutons,"Plantains are quickly becoming the brightest star in our constellation of starches. From their breakout role in our long-adored Plantain Chips, to their more recent turn as the base of our frozen Tostones and snacky Plantain Crisps, our love for their savory flavor and ability to crisp up to a superbly satisfying texture has only increased over the years. That's why, when the time came to find a medium for a crouton that was delightfully crunchy, but still decidedly gluten free, we knew that one fruit would stand head and shoulders above the rest of the bunch. Now, Trader Joe's Plantain Croutons are here to provide some resounding crunch, along with gratifyingly garlicky seasoning, to salads, soups, and anything else that might benefit from a bit of extra flavor and texture.
 
 These Plantain Croutons are made especially for us by a supplier in Ecuador who specializes in plantain-based snacks. One of the reasons they work so well is that they use green plantains, which are slightly starchier and lower in sugar, and have an almost potato-like texture. That translates to a superior crunch in every Crouton, despite containing no gluten.","['Food', 'Snacks & Sweets', 'Chips, Crackers & Crunchy Bites']",https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/plantain-croutons-066408,$1.99,5 Oz,,Gluten Free,"['PLANTAINS', 'HIGH-OLEIC SUNFLOWER OIL', 'DRIED GARLIC', 'SEA SALT']",,['Unexpected'],['1 Tbsp.(7g)'],['35 ']
85-dark-chocolate-bar-from-uganda-066292,85% Dark Chocolate Bar from Uganda,"We know our Customers love 85% dark chocolate. How do we know this? Well, because of the way our 85% Dark Chocolate Lover's Bar has been received-and consumed! Our latest dark chocolate bar sticks to this cacao percentage, but instead of coming from the Tumaco region of Colombia, the cacao in this 85% Dark Chocolate Bar comes from Uganda.
 
 The beans are from a series of small farms in Western Uganda, located at the foot of the Rwenzori Mountains. In true bean-to-bar fashion, the cacao is harvested, dried, and fermented in partnership with a 3rd generation, family-owned Italian chocolatier. But don't assume this partnership is a long-distance relationship. In fact, one of the Italian Executive Directors is based in Uganda where he helps guarantee the origin of the beans from Ugandan farmers who still own the lands on which the cacao is cultivated. It's a symbiotic partnership that yields some stellar chocolate!
 
 The final result of this African-Italian collaboration is fine, full-flavored, 85% Dark Chocolate that has rich caramel top notes and mildly fruity undertones-with just a slight acidity.

gluten-free-ginger-turmeric-granola-066340,Gluten Free Ginger Turmeric Granola,"There's something about the spicy warmth of ginger that just screams—or, rather, gingerly suggests—fall. And when you pair it with turmeric—ginger's rooty, rhizomal cousin—the fall feels kick into absolute overdrive. Perhaps not surprisingly, we're all about those fall feels... So, when one of our favorite cereal suppliers sent us a sample of a new, gluten-free Ginger Turmeric Granola, we knew it belonged on our shelves.
 
 It all starts with a sturdy base: clusters of rolled oats, oat flakes, and little brown rice crisps, all bound together with brown rice syrup and sweetened with cane sugar. Then comes a double dose of coconut (coconut flakes and shredded coconut), an onslaught of warm, fall spices (turmeric, ginger powder, and cinnamon, to be specific), a pinch of sea salt for good measure, and—the crowning ingredient—a heaping helping of candied ginger pieces. This is scrumptious stuff.
 
 Eat it out of hand. Enjoy it in a bowl with any of our coconut non-dairy beverages. Or, layer it with frozen mango purée and Greek Yogurt for a golden parfait.

chile-garlic-cashews-063991,Chile & Garlic Cashews,"With their unique, buttery, mildly nutty flavor, cashews are really enjoyable when simply roasted with a little salt. In addition to selling them this way, Trader Joe's has also capitalized on their fantastic flavor by using cashews as a base for a variety of seasonings, including our Coconut Cashews, Sesame Honey Cashews, and Thai Lime Cashews.
 
 Now, we're adding Trader Joe's Chile & Garlic Cashews to this list. Whole cashews are roasted and dusted with a seasoning that includes chile powder, garlic powder, onion powder, and salt. There's also little bit of lime powder and cane sugar to provide hints of acid and sweetness in contrast with the plentiful savoriness. Of course, Chile & Garlic Cashews are excellent eaten out of hand or next to your favorite fizzy beverage- but this flavor profile in particular also works well in recipes, like our Cashew Chicken Lettuce Wraps Recipe. Add it to your homemade stir-frys, or even Trader Joe's Mandarin Orange Chicken.

gone-berry-crazy-060577,Gone Berry Crazy!,"We are positively bananas for our Trader Joe's Gone Bananas, and you can bet that our customers are, too. In fact, those chocolate-covered banana slices are one of our best-selling frozen treats of all time!
 
 This got us thinking: what other frozen fruit frontiers can we explore? What other treats could be lying in wait, yearning to be covered in chocolate? The answer, it turns out, took us down to the strawberry fields of Northern Thailand, where we found our next gastronomic goody to go ga-ga for: Trader Joe's Gone Berry Crazy Dark Chocolate Covered Strawberry Pieces.
 
 Though the concept is simple, the results are decadent: juicy, delicious Thai Strawberries are sliced in half and enrobed in luxuriously Dark Chocolate, then flash frozen. No preparation required - in fact, we discourage you from even letting them defrost too much, lest you miss out on their snappy, snackable texture. Simply open the box and enjoy as many Pieces as you care to - which, of course, may or may not end up being the whole box.
 
 While we're sure you'll flip your lid for these Strawberries on their own, they also make great company for other desserts like our recipe for a Berry Crazy sundae. We recommend dropping a few onto a heaping bowl of our Strawberry Coconut Non-Dairy Dessert, along with a handful of crumbled Quadruple Almond Cookies. And we can't overlook their appeal as a quick dessert solution for an impromptu romantic date, especially when paired with a glass of Cecilia Beretta Spumante Rosé.

steamed-pork-ginger-soup-dumplings-065259,Steamed Pork & Ginger Soup Dumplings,"From the same supplier that helped us bring Steamed Chicken Soup Dumplings to Trader Joe's, we are thrilled to introduce Trader Joe's Steamed Pork & Ginger Soup Dumplings. Inspired by the same original soup dumplings, xiao long bao, that originated in the Jiangsu province of China, this type of dumpling is traditionally prepared in a xiaolong, the small bamboo steaming basket from which it gets its name. In English-speaking countries they're most often called Soup Dumplings because they are filled with hot soup (and therefore must be eaten carefully!) Xiao long bao are traditionally filled with pork, so this second entry in our freezers adheres closer to culinary tradition.
 
 Where we've veered from the traditional preparation is with the inclusion of ginger as a major flavor player. Our recipe includes just a bit more than five percent ginger, giving these dim sum darlings a sizeable kick of pungent, spicy heat. If you have a xiaolong lying around, feel free to use it to prepare these bites. Otherwise, you can prep them the easy way, using the microwavable tray in which they're packaged. Two minutes or less in your microwave oven yields soft, hot, incredibly flavorful results.

 Our Açaí Bowl is composed of organic fruit, including: strawberries, blueberries, and bananas, with unsweetened coconut chips, unsweetened coconut beverage-and of course, açaí. We've frozen these ingredients together in a microwave-safe bowl for quick defrosting. (If you're a planner, you can alternatively just defrost your Bowl in the fridge overnight.)

It’s a staple component in French Bordeaux, but it typically takes a backseat to the other included varietals. Trader Joe’s Petit Reserve Cabernet Franc Paso Robles contains some of those same Bordeaux components, only in this case, it’s the Cab Franc that’s driving the car.   These grapes are grown in the Central Coast region of California, specifically in Paso Robles, which is known for its Bordeaux-style blends. Partnered with Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and a couple other grape varietals, the Cab Franc really shines. The wine is vibrant and rich, with a full body, firm tannins, and plenty of acidity. It’s dark ruby red in the glass, with black cherry and plum on the nose, and a smooth zest on the tongue that includes hints of mocha and toasty oak.
